<br><h1>Goodbye from Skotos</h1>

<p>
<a href="artwork/goodbye-image.jpg"><img align="right" width=500 src="artwork/goodbye-image.jpg" align="center" border=2></a>
  Skotos was founded in 1999 with a goal of creating <a
href="about/pr/Feb05_1999.html">"multiplayer
interactive fiction on the Internet"</a>. We wanted to make games
that were <a
href="articles/evocationsys.html">more
social</a>, <a href="articles/TTnT_26.html">more
dynamic</a>, <a
href="articles/chezskoot.html">more
interactive</a>, <a
href="articles/bulksystem.html">more
realistic</a>, and <a
href="articles/GoodStorytelling.html">more
story-focused</a> than anything that had been seen before.
As with any endeavor, <a
href="about/pr/Jun25_1999.html">some</a> <a
href="about/pr/Sep06a_2000.html">projects</a>
fell by the wayside, and others prospered. Our flagship game, <a href="https://www.marrach.com/">Castle Marrach</a> <a href="about/pr/Oct2_2000.html">launched</a> on <a href="articles/TTnT_Sept21.html">September 21, 2000</a>. 

<p>In the couple of years that followed, we surged forward with all of
the excitement and enthusiasm of a dot-com company at the turn of the
century. We brought in <a href="about/pr/Oct30_2000.html">expert designers from the roleplaying field</a>, hired <a href="about/pr/Nov15_2000.html">Brian Moriarty, a legend of the interactive-fiction community</a>, made connections with existing <a href="about/pr/Sep06c_2000.html">roleplaying</a> <a href="about/pr/Nov28_2000.html">publishers</a>, and published columns by masters in the field such as <a href="articles/DAWNOF.shtml">Richard Bartle</a> and <a href="articles/bth.html">Jessica Mulligan</a>.

<p>And, we continued to launch games. Many of our earliest releases
were strategy games that were focused on building a larger gaming
community, such
as <a href="about/pr/03212002.html">Galactic
Emperor:
Hegemony</a>, <a href="about/pr/08082003a.html">Droidarena</a>, <a href="about/pr/06032003a.html">Space
Federation</a>, and the
early <a href="about/pr/05062004a.html">Days of
Wonder games</a>. However, these half-dozen associate games were just
the appetizer: roleplaying and storytelling games were always the main
course.
<a href="about/pr/06062001.html">The Eternal
City</a> was our second roleplaying game: it had already been a top
roleplaying game produced by Worlds Apart before it joined the Skotos
community. In the years that followed we
launched <a href="about/pr/06122002.html">Grendel's
Revenge</a>, <a href="about/pr/06292005.html">Lovecraft
Country</a>, <a href="about/pr/Nov28_2000.html">Ironclaw
Online</a>,
and <a href="about/pr/01032007a.html">The
Lazarus Project</a>.

<p>Skotos never grew as big as our initial dreams. The communities
never exceeded a few hundred people each. But those communities were
vibrant and exciting, and they told the stories that we'd always
dreamed of. Today, they've been telling those stories for twenty
years. We've joined in, just the least bit, with our <a
href="http://awakenings.marrach.net/">Castle Marrach comic</a> and our
<a href="http://www.lovecraftcountry.com/comic/">Lovecraft Country
comic</a>, but following the release of our games, the creativity and
continuity of these communities has mainly been thanks to the
players. Thank you!

<p>
We've now reached the twentieth anniversary of Skotos, and it's a
time of change &mdash; and just as we've long promised in Castle Marrach, we
hope this marks a New Spring. We are closing the Skotos site, but in
doing so we are also releasing our games to the world. Four of Skotos'
past games have been running independently for a few months now. We
invite you to visit them, and become a part of their stories:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.marrach.com/">Castle Marrach</a>
<li><a href="https://www.eternalcitygame.com/">The Eternal City</a>
<li><a href="https://allegoryofempires.com/">Allegory of Empires</a>
<li><a href="https://www.lazarus-project.net/">The Lazarus Project</a>
<li><a href="http://www.multirev.net/">Multiverse Revelations</a>
</ul>

We've also spent much of this year releasing our core
<a href="https://www.chattheatre.com/">Chat Theatre</a> technology as
<a href="https://github.com/ChatTheatre">open source</a>, so that you can create games of your own. Finally, we'll be maintaining an archive of our <a href="articles/articles.phtml">popular articles</a>.

Long live <a href="https://github.com/ChatTheatre/SkotOS">SkotOS</a>!
Long live <a href="https://github.com/ChatTheatre/eOS">eOS</a>! And
thank you for 20 years of support.

<p>Signing Off,

  Harte, and the many others who made Skotos great.
