Our site is optimized for frames and requires a graphical web browser, so you may find navigating it difficult without.</p>
			<p>If you do need to however, please visit <a href="../help/Find.html">http://www.skotos.net/help/Find.html</a> to find what you need, though some pages still require frames. Better yet, we recommend upgrading your browser to one that supports frames (both Netscape and Internet Explorer do for example, as do some of the lesser known browsers).
