<center><h1>Ky</h1></center>

<br><br>

<p><font size="2">
Ky, originally called by some other name, was born and raised in Iridine. He had a fairly happy life, raised by his two parents... until near his 14th birthday
when Cinereans invaded, leaving him an orphan. Having no relatives, and no one to keep an eye on him, Ky caused all kinds of mischief, like theft, and
vandalism. Misfortune occured one fateful day, when a wealthy patrician caught him stealing. On that day, he was warrented for murdering that same
patrician. To escape punishment, and to try and start afresh, Ky ran off, looking for a new home. During his travels, Ky visited many lands, mostly by
accident from running from more crimes. Still determined to start afresh, he ended up in Altene near his 18th birthday. Disliked from the beginning, Ky
almost gave up hope of ever completely turning around... that is, until he met Kylynn, a young scholar and like all Altene, trained in the staves. Beautiful,
and witty, he fell in love with her immediately. She enjoyed his company, which was something he hadn't known since his parents died. Time passed...
they became good friends, and eventually engaged. Once again, misfortune followed Ky, and now his fiance. The two of them were trapped in an alley by
a local gang. Ky, not having any real fighting expertise, watched as his beloved fiance was slain by the gang that outnumbered them. Guilt encompassed
him, believing that her death was his fault. From that point on Ky devoted himself to training, and protecting those weaker than him. Ky, as he now called
himself after his deceased fiance, trained diligently in Altene for the next 3 years. Having a new purpose in life and a new name, Ky set off for Iridine to
start off his new life...
