Sriker always had it hard, from bullies to brutes. He was born in Iridine but really didn't
know his way around untill much later. When in his spare time he would practice fighting with his friends. Once he was 17 his
father presented him with a quarterstave that he still uses to this day. As he started training with his quarterstave he found it
amazingly fun to enter contests. From this day forward he has always wanted to be one of the Iridine constables. His favorite
hobbies are sprinting and fighting (he's not fast, but he's powerful).
