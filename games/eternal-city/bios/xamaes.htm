<h1 align="center">Xamaes</h1>

<p><font size="2"><br>
Xamaes spent her day life at home with her mother Shadlock, a once hunter of all creatures
that bear hides of fine leather. From the time she was six her mother threw a spear in her
hand and began teaching her how to use it, she was always told by her mother that there
were lots of bad things out there that she needed to protect herself from. Xamaes took no
interest in her mothers teachings, she would much rather be outside playing with her
friends in the street. They were not rich, and they were not poor, her mother told her
that she longed for the thrill of the hunt once more, but gave it up the day her father
stole her heart. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Her mothers heart was not the only thing her father stole, when Xamaes
was seven her father took her down near the Hospice of the Morning Light, it was there
that she first found out what her father did for a living. He showed her the finer art of
lifting a pouch from another, particularly a wealthy patrician. She didn't realize then
that there was anything wrong with what he was doing, she thought it was just a game. She
watched as her father took pouch after pouch after pouch, all the time emptying them into
a large sack he was carrying and then merely discarding it onto the side of the road.
After several minutes of watching him take the pouches with a subtle ease, he placed a
boison dagger in her hand, and pointed to a nearby patrician that was conversing with a
scholar nearby. He told her to go get the patricians pouch just like she had seen him do
it. She looked at the boison dagger she now held, it was heavy for her, and the hilt was
made of a cold metal that didn't shine under the light of the bright sun above. She could
see her reflection in the dark boison blade of the dagger, she spent a moment looking at
how dully the metal reflected her face, then looked over at the patrician her father had
pointed to. He was short and quite wide, a man who obviously eats in great quantities, she
gazed at the tanned leather strap of the pouch she was supposed to get, looked at the
dagger again, and slowly approached the man. She looked up at the back of his head, he was
talking to the scholar and didn't seem to notice her approach, she swallowed and as best
she could she lifted the strap up a bit so she could cut it. But all did not go to plan,
she tugged too hard on the strap, and the patrician turned around promptly. With a sharp
and sudden pain to the left side of her face, she was knocked back a few feet and left
laying on the cobblestone avenue outside the hospice, the dagger she held flew from her
hand and landed near her fathers feet. He bent over and picked it up, anger filled his
eyes, he tore off the black hooded cloak he was wearing and threw it over to Xamaes, then
in one quick movement he lunged at the patrician, stabbing the dagger deep into his back.
A scream of pain, then the patrician fell to the ground, the constables were quick to
realize what had happened, they started beating on Xamaes' father with no remorse, once he
was unconscious they dragged him away... </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Three days later, the stool was kicked from under his feet, and in a
brief instance Centrozity was dead. Hung for the murder of a patrician. Xamaes' mother
Shadlock was allowed to keep one thing that the man she married owned, the rest would be
used to repay the dead patricians family, without stopping to think even for a moment, she
took his cloak. He had always said to her, &quot;If anything happens to me, anything at
all, I want you to take my cloak and travel away from this place.&quot; And she did, later
that night Shadlock left their inn room at the toga, though she didn't take the cloak, she
went up to the forest north of the city and dug her spear into the ground, then she
impaled herself upon it's sharpened blade. Her body was found in the morning by a group of
spearmen out hunting for hides, they recognized her as they once used to hunt with her,
one of them, a close friend of Shadlocks, went back to her inn room and there found
Xamaes. He took her to his small shack out in the northern forests, and looked after her. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Fourteen years later, Xamaes had long ditched her adopting parent and
had been living off the money she made hunting for leather bearing animals. She never
needed much money though, as she made her own clothes and only ever bought food, so she
never spent allot of time hunting, and did it only when she was running short on cash. She
would spend the rest of her time wandering the streets of Iridine, never doing much other
than quickly stopping for a drink of posca at a tavern. It was at such a time, when she
was heading a tavern north of the Toga, run by a man named Pego. It wasn't a fancy joint,
but they had posca, and there was never much of a crowd. On her way there, she overheard
some people talking of a festival in a far away place known as Monlon. She had been
longing to leave Iridine for as long as she could remember, and this now gave her an
excuse to do so. So she headed back to the shack where she lives, took her only two
belongings in the world, her fathers hooded cloak and her mothers cavalry spear, and she
set off for Monlon, quite a ways away. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It wasn't too long before she arrived in Vetallun, she wasn't planning
on stopping as there was still plenty of light left in the day, but she was approached by
a man named Roq, who had distaste with the way she dressed. There were others with the
same ideas soon on the scene, and before she could escape they had started the onslaught.
Four attacking one, she didn't last long, they last thing she saw was the face of the man
who goes by the name of Roq. She awoke in what appeared to be an inn room, she couldn't
see very well, but could feel that she had been bound with manacles and there was a sharp
pain in her left arm. It wasn't until several days later, when the door to the room
finally opened, a few hours more and she would of starved to death then and there. Looking
at her arm quickly, she could see the bone had penetrated the flesh, and there was blood
all over the floor where she lay. Two people entered the room, only one mattered to
Xamaes, it was Roq, the first thing he said, &quot;Here she is, the thief Xamaes.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">They say Xamaes died that day in Vetallun, killed by the undefined
hatred towards her for wearing her fathers cloak. But her body lives on, though no longer
controlled by Xamaes, the simple part-time hunter who cared for nothing buy a quiet life
away from people, now her body is the hooded cloak the others tried to destroy, the hooded
cloak that was her father, and now is her.</font></p>
