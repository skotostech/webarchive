<p><font size="2">I was born in Iridine. My mother died during child birth, and my father
was left to raise me. I always blamed myself for my mother's death, and at the age of 16 I
turned to Ereal for answers. I prayed for answers and sought counsel in priests. At the
age of 17, I saw a vision of my mother in a dream. My mother told me that her death wasn't
my fault, and that I had to continue on with my life. After I awoke that morning, I was a
changed man. I seriously listened to my father and diligently trained to become a priest.
I continued training, and at the age of 19, I became a priest. I believed that my dream
was Ereal's gift to me, and now I could spread Ereal's prayer everywhere. At the age of
20, I had a successful life for me, and I had even convinced my father to come to weekly
prayers, but it was at this time, that something happened that changed my life forever. My
father was hunting out in the forest around Iridine when a small Cineran scout party
attacked. My father was between the town and the forest, when one of the Cinerans spoted
him. He used the trees to his advantage, and made every arrow count, yet he soon ran out
of arrows. He shot down seven soldiers before they came up from behind him. I still don't
know what happened to his body. All I could find was his short bow and some money. I went
home and found my house in ashes...all my memories gone in a blaze. I left behind those
horrible times, and moved into a small shack next to the shrine of Ereal. The priest
helped me get food and clothing. Midway through the year, I moved back into the forest and
practiced my archery. Soon though, I longed for people to talk to. I came back into the
city, and found that it had not changed much. Phaedro was still the same, as was the Stone
Toga Inn. I met a rogue named Valponi who refamiliarized me with the city, and gave me
armor and supplies. He soon became my best friend. Now, a few months after I returned to
the city, I am the leader of the 'Birds of Prey' and a devoted priest. I thank you for
listening to my life, and may Ereal guide your life forever. </font></p>
