<center><h1>Niktoo's Bio</h1></center><p><font size="2">

Niktoo Radenmore<br><br>	Niktoo was born In the city of Iridine, sometime nineteen years ago. No one really<br>knows when he was born, His mother a Prostitute and his father , well you get the<br>picture. His mother was around long enough to name him and see him out the door at the<br>ripe age of 10. Very young and very afraid, Niktoo found himself in a world that was not<br>suitable for most cutthroats, let alone a young boy. He came from the harbors and spent<br>most of his time scouring the coastal alleys looking for food, and clothing he could sell to<br>make a meager living. Many a time he found himself faced staring at some of the worlds<br>most vile beings. One day why sneaking out of his makeshift shack he came upon a small<br>group of brutes drinking and brutalizing a young maiden. His eyes were fixated in shock<br>and terror, he could not believe people could be like this. His little heart trembled as he<br>grabbed hold of a small wooden club that was laying on the ground, with all his courage<br>he rushed forward swinging his hardest at the first of the three Smelly men. He barley<br>budged him as he turned angrily swatting Niktoo with his hand. With that the young boy<br>went sprawling to the ground as the taste of blood soon found its way into his mouth. The<br>man smiled and walked over coolly to the boy, and preceded to beat him near death. As<br>Niktoo lay there bleeding his young eyes caught the glimpse of the maidens right before<br>she passed on to Ereal finally at some kind of rest. The men just chuckled and walked<br>away as if it was just another day.<br><br>	Many hours passed till the young boy could pull himself together and even begin<br>to move. He steadied himself and began walking down the cold dark alley when a<br>shadowy figure appeared wearing a brightly colored mask.  Ïwell hello there young one,<br>you look as if ye have had a bit of trouble.Ó  ÏYesss, s-s-sirr I was beaten by some men<br>and they ah...lets just say a lady is no more.Ó, Niktoo replied.  Ïwhere is your mother and<br>where is your father, what is such a young child doing here on the streets?Ó  Ïwell I donÌt<br>know where my Mother is, and I donÌt know who my Father even is sir.Ó  The man<br>sighed and pulled a coin from his pouch. The man showed the coin to niktoo and with<br>one quick handed movement the coin seemed to disappear.  ÏRemember boy nothing is<br>as it seems, and life has many turns. The question is which turn to make.Ó  ÏCome with<br>me boy let me fix you up.Ó   With that the man hoisted Niktoo in the air and carried him<br>to a room by the docks and cleaned him up, patching his wound and telling him stories of<br>adventures he had while in the city. The whole time the mask was never removed. Soon<br>sleep overtook the young boy and he found himself sleeping away. The next morning<br>Niktoo awoke to an empty room and no sign of the mysterious figure.<br><br>	Niktoo slowly made his way out of the room still kinda shooken up from the night<br>before. He slowly limped down the alleys he called home and made his way out to the<br>main road. As he came to an intersection a delicious smell penetrated his senses and he<br>immediately salivated with its aroma. He looked southwardly into a  shady bar and saw, a<br>man cooking up some dolphin. He had it cut into steaks and was cooking away, not<br>minding any attention to those around. Niktoo suddenly forgot how bad he hurt as hunger<br>soon took over his instincts. He snuck in slowly only a few patrons where around and<br>they where oblivious to his as they chatted away, he got around the bar and made a<br>desperate grab for a steak and began to run. THWAP! the cook smacked him on his<br>bottom so hard he hit the floor hard. ÏBoy, watch ya trying to do you need to pay for<br>that.Ó the man bellowed. Niktoo slowly turns his battered face to view the man. ÏNah, sir<br>IM sorry but I have no money and I was hungry, havenÌt eaten for days sir. So sorry.Ó A<br>small tear streams along the boys face. ÏAh, lad what da hell happen to you?Ó The man<br>introduced himself, his name was Marcellus and owned the place. Niktoo recalled his life<br>and his tale of last night to the barkeep. Marcellus fed him and a couple of the working<br>girls tended to his wounds. Marcellus chatted with the lad and ended taking a liking to<br>him. He ended up taking him in. He got a cot to sleep on and free food, all he had to do<br>was sweep, do dishes, and tidy up the bar a bit. Niktoo happily agreed and began to take<br>in his sights. He soon found an interest in the gladius and books, and would pick up on<br>anything a weary traveler would be willing to show him or teach him. As he matured his<br>observation skills grew more keen and things became more real to him. Before long the<br>working girls took a liking to him and taught him a few more tricks he could of only<br>learned in this atmosphere.<br><br>	Then one day he embarked out on his own, told Marcellus he would stop into see<br>him and visit the girls. It was time for Niktoo to make his own destiny and learn more of<br>the world around. Niktoo found the world to be full of half hearted heroes and selfish<br>saints. He soon found himself helping others as much as he could giving them money and<br>listening to them helping anyway he could. Niktoo remembered what it was like to go<br>hungry and made sure to do his best that no one else did. He used his knowledge he had<br>picked up and tried to pass it along as best as he could.  He never forgot the masked man<br>and what he said, and he never forgot that trick. Some day you may see him setting at the<br>toga sipping his wine and winking at all the young ladies, taking in the sights. Listen and<br>ye may even learn a thing or two.
