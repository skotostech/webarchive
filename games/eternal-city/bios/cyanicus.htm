<center><h1>Cyanicus Ulyssia</h1></center>

<br>

<p><font size="2">

Born in the southern part of Iridine, Cyanicus lived as part of a trader family in The Eternal City. He learned the trades while he
was young and even some literature. When he was young, his parents intended for Cyanicus to become a scribe and a
merchant. He was the youngest of two sons and one daughter, now deceased. Cyanicus never realized his career of a writer
and poet, instead he lived through the worst of the Cineran occupation of Iridine, taking odd jobs to help feed the starving
family and to help end the occupation.
<br><br>
His family was killed by Cinerans on several separate occasions. His father, Pleio Ulyssia and Ulita Ulyssia were killed by
Cineran soldiers in a short lived rebellion. Janeus Ulyssia, the middle sister died during Calsuan's rebellion, finally, Irea Synea
died from beheading as a result of being accused of treason.
<br><br>
The death of Janeus was one of the more sorrowful stories. Two years before Calsuan's death, during the rebellion, the younger
Cyanicus then 15, Janeus, 19, Auril, and Kelid attacked a Cineran soldier on the street after Calsuan declared a state of open
rebellion. Janeus led a Cineran soldier to the alleys and then Auril and Kelid surrounded him. However, when Cyanicus was
supposed to jump from the roofs and stab the Cineran in the skull with the tip of a stolen gladius, he hesitated for several
seconds. As a result, the soldier managed to get a hit on Janeus, a disemboweling thrust into her chest. Auril left the battle with
a slashed arm while Kelid was mortally wounded. On that day, Cyanicus lost two people, a cherished friend and a sister. After
that day, Auril ran away from Iridine, having been warranted for murder and treason. Cyanicus lived near the sandbar, hiding
his face from the authorities.
<br><br>
After slightly more than a year, Cyanicus came from the shadows, after the Cinerans fled away. He was reluctant to make
friends, afraid that they would die at his hands, like the death of his sister. He is a loyal and trusted friend and defends the honor
of Iridine and his friends in whatever way he can, preferably by his words, then the trusty edge of his gladius.
<br><br>
Nowadays, he is a wandering healer in search of people to help, talk up a storm, to obnoxiously scold wrongdoers all while
sipping a cup of nice hot tea, and punish evil beings with a few high pitched toots from his trusty flute. You can usually find him
infront of the Stone Toga (New shrine of Ereal). He now strives to become a priest of the sect of the Revealing light.
