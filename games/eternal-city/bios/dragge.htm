<h1 align="center">Dragge Almerca</h1>



<p><font size="2">Dragge grew up in a poor house in Altene.&nbsp; His father was killed

while serving in the Alteanian Legions.&nbsp; Dragge's mother died during the birth of

Dragge's little brother.&nbsp; Dragge kept himself and his brother alive by hunting stray

animals and taking bounty missions for the &quot;lords&quot; of town.&nbsp; When Dragge's

brother was 13 years old.&nbsp; He went on his first bounty mission. Dragge's brother was

killed in the process.&nbsp; He had tried to take on a band of theives and failed.&nbsp;

Dragge found him lying in the middle of the street unclothed and dead.<br>

<br>

From then on Dragge swore to avenge the death of his brother.&nbsp; He followed the band

of theives all the way to Iridine.&nbsp; When he got there, he was met up by twice as many

theives.&nbsp; Dragge succeded in killing the band that had killed his brother, but had to

retreat before the others killed him.&nbsp; Dragge met Brett, Cinerio, and other members

of a group called the Mystical Knights of Bettendorf.&nbsp; Dragge joined this group of

do-gooders.&nbsp; Dragge also met Lady Locanda of the Iridine Constables.&nbsp; Dragge was

inspired by Locanda and inquired about becoming a constable. Dragge is still waiting to

become a constable and is still a member of The MKBs.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

He is single and at the age of Twenty is very fit.&nbsp; Much of Dragge's past though has

been forgotten by him.&nbsp; It is believed that Dragge's memories of his childhood were

blocked out by his sub-consciousnous.&nbsp; Dragge is an inspiring warrior and always

loves to go hunt for the stray animals as he did when he was a child. </font></p>
