Okay, I will try to keep this short. Well, my name is Moonlite Crashton (duh). 
I am a healer and as you may of noticed I never use double negatives. 
I was born in the Safelands. I lived by a crystal clear stream and my house 
was behind a hill. I have two brothers, Herc and Starhead 
(now dead, thank Ereal), and two sisters, Pheobe and Sunshine. 
Untill I was 13, my mother would not let me off my property.
 She was afraid of all the thugs. When I was 15 I was to marry Alex, 
you have probally already read his love letters to me. 
When he died, he made me want to be a healer. 
When I was 18 I left the Safelands and went to Iridine to find a job. 
Now I am just a 20 year old single girl that loves kids. 
So, that is my life.
