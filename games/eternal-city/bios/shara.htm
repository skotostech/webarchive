Hiya, I'm Shara. I was born and raised in Harmony, a small lumber town in the Republic of Iridine. I lived with my parents, and my brother. My father was
of course a lumberjack (*sigh*), and my mother was just a housewife. Not too sound mean, but I hated that town. I would always wander as far from the
racket of chopping down trees as I could. Not only was the noise annoying, but many of the men would stare at me when I was around, being one of the
few women in the town. So, not surprisingly, as soon as my parents would pemit it, I came to Iridine, hoping for a better life then being gawked at by a
bunch of lumberjacks.
