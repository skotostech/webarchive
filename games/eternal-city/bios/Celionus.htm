<center><h1>Celionus Johnson</h1></center><p><font size="2">

I was born in Altene to Michael and Michelle Johnson.  I enlisted in the Altene Army when I was 18.  I served in the Black Wolves for four years.  I had been sending my money home to my mother because she was sixk and dying.  The day I got out of the army mt mother died.  I had no money and was forced to turn to thievery.  I left Altene for Iridine in hope of finding a new life.  But I did not, I was forced to turn to thievery once again.  One day in jail, I met a man that changed my life.  I decided to go back to my Altene ways and use my stave.  Now I only use my thieving skills to take pouches of thugs and brutes to make my fight easier.  I hope that someone will read this and decided against thievery.  That's all for now.<br><br><br>                                                                                                                                        -Celionus<br><br>
