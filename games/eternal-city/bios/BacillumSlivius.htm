<h1 align="center">Bacillum Slivius</h1>

<p><font size="2">Born under a rather large Altene family, Bacillum lead a rather happy
life. His father was the typical mercenary stavesman common to the region, and his mother
mostly stayed home, watching after he and his brothers and sisters. He enjoyed his
childhood, and got along fairly well with his siblings, and other friends. All through
this time, he had been training with his staff, dreaming to be just like his father, and
so, having heard of the high number of successful Altenes in Iridine, decided to leave his
family and friends behind, and continue his training in The Eternal City.</font></p>
