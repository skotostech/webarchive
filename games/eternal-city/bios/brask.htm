</FONT><SMALL>Brask Pereldar was born the eldest son of Peripus Pereldar,
a lesser Cineran Warlord. Brask's father was a lazy man squandering the land
his grandfather had left him, and waisting away the Pereldar holdings till
they were a mere shadow of their former self. Brask's early life, like most
Cineran children, was harsh. His father routinly beat, and mistreated him.
Despite all this, as is the time honored Cineran tradition, he did teach
Brask one thing. How to fight. Brask poured all his free energy into the
gladius, letting the anger at his father, and the anger at his family's fall
from greatness fuel him. Therefore it was no surprise that when he reached
the age of 16 he challanged his father, and slew him, therby taking possession
of the Pereldar holdings. What Brask was left with after his father's death
was in sad shape, a few small farms, and a run down fort not big enough to
house 50 soldiers. Together with his younger brother Brask decided that the
only way to rebuild his family's fortune would be to take up the banner of
a mercenary. After buying his brothers right to be a Cineran, Brask left
him in charge of his lands and went off to rebuild his house. Over the years
Brask has served with, or against, nearly every army in Midlight, in a miriad
of roles. He has earned the reputation of being a hard man. He will not kill
unless paid to do so, and will leave his employer at the exact minute his
contract has been fullfilled, even if that be in the heat of battle. Brask
has made many trips back to Cinera, to check on his holdings, and to fight
duels to inlarge his lands, and over the years, bit by bit, he has managed
to regain much of the land his father lost. Recently however, after serving
a short contract in the Blackroot mountains, Brask recieved a letter from
his brother warning that the war with Iridine had made it increasingly more
dangerous for Brask to come back at that time. His brother warned him that
he had made many enemies over the years, and even the money he had sent home
would not buy Brask's safety. Knowing that going back to Cinera ment an
unhonorable death at the hands of his enemies Brask has decided to wait until
things cool down in Iridine.</SMALL>
