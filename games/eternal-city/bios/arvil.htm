<p><font size="2">I came to iridine when I was quite young. I never knew my family at all.
Then I met Cheraa, who had the same last name as me and told me she had a long lost
sister.(me) She told me I had a sister that hated me and never wanted to see my face named
Lindsi. I wasn't very good at anything. I had rank 1 at one-handed crushing and the only
good thing I could do was cook. I soon found a new friend. Who wasn't very good at
anything too and had a big family too. I treat her like a sister. But chera nor lindsi
know whatever happened to our parents</font></p>
