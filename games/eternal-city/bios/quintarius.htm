<center><h1>Quintarius Maximus</h1></center>

<br>

<p><font size="2">

Quintarius Maximus was born on the 197th year of the Republic, in a small town in Windward, the son of Williusius and
Aphroditeine Maximus, local farmers. He was their only child, his only other relative left to carry on the family name being his
adopted cousin, Proteaus. He had a happy childhood, and his parents were very rich farmers. He was also lucky to have a rich
uncle, Trivious Maximus, who adopted Proteaus, and lived with Maximus's household. Trivious owned a successful mining
opperation. 
<br><br>

Quintarius's life was tranquil. But when he turned 19, he wanted some adventure. He did not want to join the 700 year farming
tradition, and has dreams for winning independence for Windward. So, he went to Iridine, with his cousin Proteaus. 
<br><br>

He has recently bought a shovel to continue his family's tradition of remebering his ancestors buy digging up things, i.e., most
Windward jobs require digging.
