<center><h1>Gabrie Celesta</h1></center><p><font size="2">

Gabrie Celesta is a young Altene girl, who moved to Iridine in the hopes of finding great <br>adventure and wonder.  She made the trip with her three best friends: Xeran, Medrinnor, and Rydial.  She also came along with her twin sister Precis Mujinbeam; the last name difference<br>was due to a mistake at birth, when another family claimed Precis as their own by mistake.<br>Either way, these five friends held out for each other like a family of their own.....<br><br>Until tragedy struck.<br><br>Once arriving in Iridine, Rydial was framed of a crime, and sent to jail; she was never heard from again.  And Precis and Medrinnor, who had decided to return to Altene and visit old friends, were killed in a massive assault by monsters.  Gabrie is the only one left; although Xeran is there to back her up, she is torn in her soul about the past.  All she can think of is.....<br><br>"Someday, Somewhere......will I be all alone???"<br><br>Right now, Gabrie is thriving as an Altene warrior; she tries not to worry about the past.  Her kindness to others tends to overshadow her true feelings, however.  Hopefully, Gabrie will never, ever be alone.....<br>
