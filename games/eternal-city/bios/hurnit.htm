Darned Youngsters..Oh, hullo there. I'm Hurnit, Hurnit Halavoy. Oh, you want to know a little about me, eh? Well, I'm older then most of ya, seventy-nine
last I checked. *cough* Hrmm...oh yes, me. I was born and raised in Iridine, joined the legio when I was nineteen, I believe. Served for twenty years as a
grunt. I knew the gladius well, fought in many battles. I'm darn lucky to be living. Well any way, after my twenty years, I quit, and went and got me a
lovely wife. Best times of my life, until she died in child-birth a year later. Kid died too. *sigh* I felt it was a bit my fault, and I was tired of death and the
life I'd been living. So, i quit practicing with the gladius when I was...hrmmm...forty-three maybe. Well, I hated myself, so I left the city. Wandered for
damn near thirty years, more then most have been breathing it seems. I came back, longing to be back home. I sort of keep myself in exile outside the city,
because I don't want to bump into my wife's family..they sorta want to kill me.. So I live in the forest not far from the cemetary where my wife was buried,
just down the road. I keep gettin' attacked by these ugly fellers though... I suppose I should learn to defend myself, my homemade torches to hurt much
when I throw 'em at 'em. I refuse to go back to swords..probably too old to move quick enough any how...doubt I could pick up a darned club...
