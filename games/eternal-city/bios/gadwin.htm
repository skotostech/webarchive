<center><h1>Gadwin</h1></center><p><font size="2">

<br>The boy was asleep, leaning against a tree. <br>The sun rose in the distance. The light, shining on the boyís eyes, woke him up. <br>He looked around and, for a moment, couldnít remember where he was. Then, as he <br>remembered, he sighed. <br>Taking his sack, he stood up, dusted himself down and began walking. <br> <br>*One week earlier* <br> <br>The citizen walked past the man and boy without suspecting anything. When his back was <br>turned to them, the man whispered to the boy, ì Go on...do it now...quietly...î <br>ìIím not doiní it!î shouted the boy. <br>The man cringed as the citizen heard the sudden outburst and looked round, but, still not <br>suspecting anything, carried on walking. The man breathed a sigh of relief and turned to his son. <br>ìJust once?î the man pleaded. <br>ìNO!î shouted the boy and ran off. <br>The man growled and ran after him. <br> <br>The front door burst open and the boy ran in. <br>ìHere we go again...î sighed his mother. <br>ìIíll never do it!î shouted the boy, ìThieviní is wrong!î <br>The man frowned as he walked in. ìItís a way of life...î he said sternly, ì...our way of life.î  <br>ìItís not mine!î shouted the boy and ran out onto the street again. <br>ìHeís just a child...î said the woman, ì...why do you have to force him to steal?î the man frowned at his wife and said ìThe child must learn someday, he has to stop living in a dream world. All I hear is how heís gonna be the best sword fighter ever...he needs to stop liviní in a fantasy world and face up to reality! We need food!î <br>ìI know we need food... ì sighed the woman, ì...but that doesnít mean a boy of sixteen should have to steal.î <br>ìLike it or not, heís gonna to have to!î shouted the man and sat down. <br> <br>Out in the street, the boy was still running. <br>ìGadwin! Wait!î  <br>The boy looked round. He smiled as he saw the girl and stopped running. He waited for her to catch up then she said, ìWhere are you going so fast?î <br>Gadwin sighed and replied; ìAnywhere.î  <br>ìAhh...now I understand,î sighed the girl, ìyour dad making you steal again?î <br>Gadwin sighed again and nodded. ìWhy does he have to steal?î he asked, ìstealinís wrong, why canít he get a good job? Like in a shop or somethiní?î <br>ìI donít know,î said the girl, ìmaybe he doesnít know how to do anything else except steal.î <br>ìThen heíd better learn! And fast!î shouted Gadwin and started running again. <br>The girl grinned at and chased after him. <br> <br>Back at the house, the man emptied the contents of his sack onto the table. His wife sighed at <br>the small pile of stolen pouches and poor quality amulets. <br>ìWould have been more if the damned boy helped out!î shouted the man. <br>ì Well he doesnít want to, so leave him alone!î the woman shouted back. <br>ìNot ëtil the day he gets his head out of the damn clouds!î the man was getting angrier. <br>The woman recognised the signs and asked ìGoing drinking tonight?î <br>ìOf course Iím goiní drinkiní! What else is there to do!?î shouted the man and stormed out. The woman sighed and sat down. <br> <br>In the streets, the girl had caught up with Gadwin and pinned him to a wall. <br>ìMan!î he exclaimed, ìHow'd ya get so fast?!î The girl grinned and said, ìIíve been training. <br>Come on, Iím hungry, lets go and get something to eat.î  <br>ìNo!î shouted Gadwin, ìIím leaviní!î <br>The girl shook her head and smiled ìAgain?î <br>ìThis time Iím really leaviní!î shouted Gadwin, ìand not cominí back!î <br>The girl sighed. ìWhy?î she asked, <br>ìI canít live with him any longer!î shouted Gadwin. <br>ìStop shouting at meî frowned the girl, ìI didnít do anything.î <br>ìSorry...î sighed Gadwin. <br>As a group of Constables ran past, Gadwin gasped and exclaimed ìOh no! My mum!î <br>The girl gasped and they both ran back to his house. <br> <br>They arrived to see his mother and father being lead away by four tough looking Constables. <br>Two more were searching his house. <br>ìMum!î shouted Gadwin. <br>His mother looked back at her son and began to cry. <br>He watched until they were out of sight then darted past the Constables into his house. <br>He grabbed his gladius, his knife, some food, a torch and his savings, shoved them into his <br>fatherís empty sack, took it, and went back out out. <br> <br>Without looking back at the girl who was waiting for him outside, he began running.... <br>
