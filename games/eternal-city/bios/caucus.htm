My mother named me Cicero, which means Chickpea in Iridine.  She told me I <br>was named after a famous patrician.  I loved her.  I wanted to help her out, <br>and as soon as I was big enough I'd kill rats on the street with a stick.  <br>She'd skin them for me and I could sell the pelts for a sen each.  Those <br>were happy days.<br><br>When I was seven I was big for my age and they let me join a kid gang.  We<br>killed rats and cats and dogs, and also we looted the occasional corpse.  We<br>spent more time arguing about how to split up the loot than we did hunting.  <br>Eventually we settled on rules.  The one to hit first got the pelt, the one <br>to hit second got the skull, the one who made the last hit before the death <br>got the stomach, and so on.  What made it work was that we all had more to<br>gain from hunting together later than we did from the one dog.  Also, the<br>longer we spent arguing the more likely some of the big boys would find us<br>and take it all.  I told uncle Classius about that and he said it was the<br>same way with the grownups.  Uncle Classius showed me a few tricks with a<br>wooden sword, and he tried to teach me about how to distract people's <br>attention away from some things and onto others, but I was too slow to<br>understand.  I could tell he was disappointed.  He might have been my <br>father.<br><br>When I was 14 I was still big for my age and mama tried to keep me home at <br>night all the time.  See, where we lived there were strangers who kept <br>coming in and doing whatever they wanted.  They'd break into people's houses<br>and steal anything they found, and they'd attack people on the street and <br>kill them and loot the bodies.  We were poor.  The guys who could afford <br>good weapons and armor and training could do what they wanted and we <br>couldn't stop them.  Some of the older kids vowed to kill the looters but <br>more often than not they got killed themselves.  When a kid looked like he <br>was actually dangerous they'd call a bunch of looters together and gang up <br>on him.  And even when some of the looters got killed there were always more <br>and more of them.  They had us outnumbered.  Every now and then one of the <br>grown men came home on leave from the army.  They wouldn't let him bring his <br>weapons home but he'd clear out the looters with whatever gear came to hand.  <br>Then in a couple of days he'd be gone and they'd come back.  I asked one of <br>them who was staying with mama why he couldn't stay and protect us.  He got <br>all sad and said it was more important to protect us from the Cinerans.  I <br>asked him what was the point, if we were getting killed anyway?  He said the<br>Cinerans would be worse, they'd make slaves out of us all, poor people, <br>rich people, looters, everybody.  'It isn't good here, but at least you're a<br>free man.  Irideans will not be slaves.'<br><br>My gang argued about what to do when we were big enough.  Selene said we <br>should go up to them and tell them we were people too, we were Iridene too, <br>and they should leave us alone.  Nobody else thought that would work.  After <br>all, Brutus robbed and raped anybody he could catch from other kid gangs, <br>and he knew they were Iridene.  Baldur said we should stay home at night <br>and leave the streets to them, and just defend in the doorways if they tried <br>to come in, in a doorway they could only come at us one at a time.  He <br>insisted they wouldn't burn down our houses; that wouldn't get them anything <br>at all.  I wasn't sure they wouldn't.  Most of us thought we should do our <br>level best to kill them regardless the odds.  'We are Iridine, dammit!'  But <br>I remembered what Uncle Classius had said.  Courage is for dupes and fools.  <br>If you have a good plan and the means to carry it out, you can butcher the <br>fools who think their bravery will make the difference.  I thought about his <br>advice and came up with a plan.  It took ten of us.  When we found a lone <br>looter we'd have three guys go after him, and three more in the alley on <br>either side to catch him if he tried to run away.  The tenth guy would go <br>tell the others if he did run, so they could double-time it to his other <br>side -- wherever he went we'd be waiting for him.  If more looters showed <br>up we'd get together and all run as a group.  Maybe it was a good plan but <br>my growth had stopped; I was getting stronger but no taller.  They wouldn't<br>follow me unless I was the tallest, and the tallest guy wouldn't try it out<br>because it wasn't his idea.<br><br>I listened carefully to uncle Classius when he'd talk to me.  Here's a <br>sample story he told me from his army days:<br><br>  'I was on picket duty.  That means, me and one other guy were supposed to<br>stay outside the trenches all night.  If the Cinerans sneaked up on us they<br>couldn't kill us both without making noise and that would alert the camp.  <br>We were sacrifices, see.  You can't be alert for them, not all night every<br>night you have picket duty.  If you try you just stay scared at first and<br>after awhile you get bored.  That's why the guy who sneaks up on pickets has<br>such a good chance.  So anyway, it was raining, and we knew the Cinerans<br>weren't coming that night, and we were both pretty miserable.  And Simulus<br>said he knew where there was a bar open, not very far.  We could sit in a<br>warm dry bar all night and get back to our picket before dawn.  No way would<br>an officer come check on us in the rain, with no moon.  He could bring a<br>torch and be a shining target if there *were* any Cinerans, or he could <br>shout out the password and warn us he was coming -- he'd be hoping to catch<br>us asleep -- or he could try to sneak up on us and it would be a perfect<br>chance for us to kill him for a Cineran.  They were supposed to check but<br>they hardly ever did.<br><br>  'So I followed Simulus.  I followed close, I wasn't sure I could find my<br>way back without him.  He found the place but it wasn't lit up, and when he<br>pounded on the door some citizens started screaming inside.  'Don't hurt us,<br>we didn't do anything, we follow Ereal completely!'  They lit a lamp and got<br>a good look at us before we ran off.  It was the wrong place.  He couldn't <br>find it, and as it turned out he couldn't find the way back either.  At dawn<br>we were on a road somewhere.  We got a ride on a provision cart heading back<br>to camp.  We were in trouble.<br><br>  'They hadn't had a good example for months, and it looked like we would be<br>it.  They'd pick a ringleader to hang and the dupe would get fifty stripes.<br>The one who confessed would be the dupe, but if we both confessed they'd <br>hang us both.  But they needed a confession.  I told Simulus, deny <br>everything, don't talk, trust me.  He said he would.<br><br>  'They took us to legio commander Androcles.  He smiled.  'You boys were <br>busy.  You left your picket.  You tried to loot some citizens.  You are in <br>smelly sewage.'  He questioned us separately.  I told him that we'd heard <br>some suspicious noise at the next picket over, so we went to make sure they <br>were OK.  But we got lost and spent the whole night looking for our place <br>again.  I hoped Simulus wasn't saying anything, if he did Androcles would <br>find some difference between the stories, and tell us he knew we were lying.  <br>He'd do that even if we'd been telling the truth, nobody can tell the same <br>story the same way.  He sent us away and told us to go back to our unit but <br>wouldn't let us have any duties and we were not to talk to each other.  The <br>other guys congratulated us for getting out of all the work.<br><br>  'The next day he called us back and interrogated us some more separately.<br>I told him the same story.  Simulus looked scared coming out.  The second <br>day the guys weren't as happy about doing our work for us.  The same thing<br>the third day.  By then all our buddies were mad at us.  By the end of the<br>week I was getting really tired of laying around.  You wouldn't think a <br>soldier would be ready to beg for work, but I almost was.  And Simulus was <br>looking more and more frazzled.  The guys were treating us like we were <br>already dead but we just hadn't stopped twitching yet.<br><br>  'The twelfth day I told him something new.  'You gotta understand.  It was<br>the new moon and foggy.  The Cinerans could have come right by us and not <br>found us.  Simulus remembered a great brothel in easy walking distance, and<br>he told me if they threatened to report us we could just kill them all.  <br>You'd have done the same thing in my place wouldn't you?  Would you stand<br>around all night in a cold rain when you could...?'  He laughed and said he<br>reckoned he would.  'Don't worry, Classius, I understand exactly and I want<br>to help you get all this over with.'  He called in a scribe who wrote down<br>the whole story.<br><br>  'The next day he called a court-martial, with our unit commander and his<br>commander and Androcles and his own commander in for the occasion.  He told<br>me to tell him what happened again.  'We were on picket duty.  We heard a<br>suspicious noise at the next picket over so we went off to make sure they <br>were OK.  But we got lost and spent the whole night trying to find our <br>picket again.'  Androcles jumped up from his camp stool, roaring.  'That<br>isn't what you told me yesterday!'  I faced him.  'I told you the truth <br>every day for two weeks and you wouldn't take it.  I finally figured out <br>that the story I told you yesterday was the only one you could hear.'  His<br>mouth worked back and forth like he'd just been impaled.  The court let us<br>off.<br><br>  'He could have had us killed anyway, but he cared more about keeping order<br>than about saving face.  He could kill guys who disobeyed orders and <br>everybody else would obey orders, but if he killed guys for doing something<br>stupid everybody else would just get scared.  If you kill all the stupid<br>soldiers then who's going to be on the front lines tomorrow?<br><br>  'Simulus was a good guy.  He didn't crack.  He could have gotten us both<br>killed but he was brave enough to stick it out.  He was a good soldier.'<br><br>And here's a story from when Classius went into politics:<br><br>  'I looked at Cassius, and I admired him, and I wanted to be like him.  But<br>I didn't know anybody who had any influence.  Politicians do each other <br>favors, and they don't do favors for people who don't have favors to do in<br>return.  I didn't have anything but my admiration for Cassius.  But I <br>figured I didn't have anything to lose either.  So I went to Plopulus, who<br>was the most influential guy there, and I asked to work for him.<br><br>  'Plopulus asked me who sent me, and I said nobody.  He told me that he had<br>eighteen other people applying for the job, and every one of them had an <br>influential politician backing him.  Why did I think I had a chance?  I said<br>I had nothing to lose.  He grinned and told me I was hired.  Then he gave me<br>my first lesson in politics.  'If I hired any one of those puukars, they<br>would have owed a favor to the guy who got them the job.  I don't need that<br>and I won't have it.  You belong to me and me alone.  When you do somebody a<br>favor then later you can call it in for me.  Don't accept any favors unless<br>you need it to do my work.  If you're smart enough, when I retire you can be <br>me.'<br><br>I asked Classius's advice about the looters, next time he visited mama.  He <br>looked pained.  'Nobody who lives where you live can do anything about them.'  <br>I persisted.  He said, 'Can you find a way to end the war?  When the army <br>comes home the veterans who live there will protect the place.  Assuming we <br>don't lose, or take too many losses.'  I thought there had to be something I <br>could do.  'Leave.  It's a battle you can't win, not head-on.  If you leave <br>there's a chance they won't kill you and you have no chance here.  Maybe <br>you'll find some way to get influence out in the world; you can have none<br>here.'  I thought about it.  Leave mama?  She needed me to bring her <br>customers and protect her from them.  But she'd get by.  Baldur died.  He<br>was drinking in a bar late, and got thrown out, and a pack of looters found<br>him on the street and killed him.  He wasn't ready for them, he didn't even<br>have his boots on.  I heard them yelling, 'Look!  A thug!' and I wanted to<br>go to him but there were too many.  Brutus killed a looter and got enough<br>loot to live on for two years.  But he didn't have a plan to stop them <br>ganging up on him, he was just lucky.  <br><br>I asked Classius if he could use his influence for me.  'You don't want <br>favors from me.  My friends were fickle and my enemies persistent.  You <br>don't need to inherit my enemies.  But you don't need much just now.  All <br>you need is a way out.'  I looked up my cousin Sardinia, and she agreed to <br>help.  It was right at my eighteenth birthday, and she helped me register <br>as an adult citizen.  The magistrates told me my name was stupid and <br>enrolled me as 'Caucus'.  I let them.  Sardinia introduced me to lots of <br>people.  Suddenly they didn't think of me as somebody they could just kill,<br>or anyway mostly not.  Funny how that works.  So long as they thought of me<br>as 'a thug' they felt fine about killing me any time they could catch me at<br>night.  Once they saw me as 'Caucus' they seemed to think I was one of them.<br>And as a registered adult I could put my money in the bank instead of a hole<br>in the ground.  Every now and then somebody steals some of it when I try to<br>deposit money, but it looks like once it gets into the bank it's safe.  I <br>can actually save money and buy things that might not get stolen the next<br>day.  Of course the stronger people will steal from me, it's always that<br>way, only not as fast.  A lot of things have changed but I guess some are <br>just the same.  I'd like to help out the people I grew up with but I don't<br>really know how.<br><br>Every now and then I go home to visit my mama.  I have to be careful.  One<br>night I saw Selene on the street.  I said, 'Hi, Selene!'.  <br>  She got out her dagger and said, 'Just drop your money and leave.'.  <br>  'Selene, don't you remember me?  It's me, Cicero, Chickpea.  We were each <br>other's first lovers.'.  <br>  'Can you block this?', and she tried to stab me.  <br>  'Selene, don't be that way, it's *me*.'  <br><br>But she wouldn't listen.  As far as she was concerned, I didn't live there <br>any more.  It's that way with everybody but mama, and mama seems like she<br>doesn't really welcome me except when I bring money.  I'd like to find a way<br>to help my old friends but I'm not completely sure how loyal I ought to be <br>to them now.  And I don't know what to do, either.  Somebody told me I <br>should tell the constables, but the first three constables I looked at had<br>all gone to the alleys themselves to attack 'thugs'.  Maybe a patrician who<br>was a politician could do something, but why would they?  I asked uncle <br>Classius what patricians were like.  'You know how the thieves are the <br>richest people around, and the ones who tell everybody in the alleys what to<br>do?  Patricians are just like the thieves you already know, only richer.'<br><br>I guess I'll just live my life until I die, like everybody else.  It seems<br>like there ought to be something more, but damned if I know what it is.<br>
