<h1 align="center">Joshius Balius</h1>



<p><font size="2">I, Joshius Balius was an Altene for most of my life I worked with my

father learning my countries ways, but I was still sad since my mother had died due to the

plague.&nbsp; I lived on but i soon got bored of Altene and decided it would be time to

move on.&nbsp; Although i tried many places like Tuchea, Windward, and even Cinera I

finally decided on my new home Iridine and I've met so many wonderful people including

Cinerio Hope, Tigerus, Dragge and some stranger people like Bobo or Brett.&nbsp; I am also

happy to say I've joined the local army known as Legion although my father would not be

proud, but sometimes you gotta say screw what anyone else thinks I'm doin this for me. </font></p>
