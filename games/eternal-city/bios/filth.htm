<h1 align="center">Filth</h1>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><br>
Filth was born in Cinera and brought up by his mother alone. His mother who
was very, very young brought up Filth with lots of love and care but she 
realized that he had problems that she couldn't help with. Filth's mother 
never talked about Filth's father and Filth never asked questions...
all Filth wanted to do was play and make friends, but other children hated 
Filth because he as most of them said was &quot;stupid&quot;. A lot of the times he 
would come home with cuts and bruises from where the other kids had beat 
him up. Filth had a hard time growing up- he didn't really understand much 
of what was going on. Filth's mother realized that Filth had a knack of 
handling knives when she told him to cut up a some carrots for the stew. 
He handled the knife with care and started to chop fastly and accurately. 
So Filth's mother sent him training with knives with what little money she
had, thinking that maybe with this practice he could defend himself and be
of use somehow. Filth trained and trained and hunted with his dog, Dregnor. 
One day when he was playing with Dregnor in a field having a really good 
time, a gang surrounded him. Filth, not thinking what they were planning,
started to talk to them and shake their hands. They pushed Filth to the 
floor and tied him up. They took Dregnor, who was only a young dog who 
couldn't defend himself, to a tree next to Filth and beat it to death,
then left Filth tied up to the tree crying and shouting his dogs Name. After 
this incident Filth never went out and just stayed inside crying or,
just being quiet. Filth had no other friends so he had no one to play with,
so his mother was his only friend. One day when Filth's mother was away at 
work the same gang that killed Dregnor came to Filth. At first Filth didn't 
recognize them and he smiled and waved to them, but as they came closer 
Filth saw red... all he could remember was his little doggie Dregnor 
yowling and barking. Filth grabbed his tin dagger from the ground and ran 
at the gang. He plunged his dagger into one of the boy's hands. The boy 
screamed as Filth realized what he had done. Filth dropped his dagger and 
started to cry. The boys beat Filth black and blue and then cut of one of 
his fingers. Filth got home and cried himself to sleep. For weeks he stayed 
inside doing nothing. Then some men came one day and threw him and his 
mother out. Because of lack of money his mother had lost her house. Filth
and His mother became beggars. Always on the look out for food and money, 
Filth did the odd job but was thrown out the next day. His mother was 
worried for him. A strange man offered to buy Filth as a slave to work for 
him on the farm. Filth's mother realized that life wouldn't be good for 
Filth as a slave but at least he would get food and care. So, she sold 
Filth to this man for 100d and Filth became a slave. Filth's mother left 
Cinera and moved onto Iridine disgraced with her self. Years passed and Filth 
worked hard... but he was still young and missed his mother. One night 
Filth took some of the strange man's money and left. Filth left everything 
behind and went in search of his mother. He had heard from the strange man 
that his mother had moved to Iridine, so he went off on his merry way. He 
was alone for a very long time with no one to talk to. While walking along 
a river near to Iridine he came across a sack... as he entered he heard a 
voice. Filth looked around and saw a skull. He picked it up and it started 
to talk to him. (In his head) Well, Filth found a friend that talked for 
ages and kept him company. People stopped and stared as Filth passed 
talking to a skull in his hand. Then he arrived in Iridine. Now, to find 
mother...
