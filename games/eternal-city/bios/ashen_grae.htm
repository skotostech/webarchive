<h1 align="center">Ashen Grae</h1>

<p><font size="2"> There weren't any storms, high winds, or other natural pyrotechnics on
the night of the birth of Ashen Grae.&nbsp; All seemed calm in his Altene village on that
night, to some extent even for his mother.&nbsp; After seven other births, this one seemed
almost routine, and would have been wholly unremarkable, except for his father's haste in
providing a name - so many siblings had tried his imagination, and, well, the boy's eyes
were grey, weren't they?&nbsp; And so Ashen was born into a large warrior family,
well-regarded for strength and ability by even the high standards of his countrymen.
&nbsp; Unfortunately, Ashen didn't completely fit the mold that his elder siblings had
established.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Ashen lacked the hulking strength and size that seemed so normal for his family.
&nbsp; During his many scraps with the larger boys, he learned to take advantage of other
talents:&nbsp; an impressive natural agility, and a love for battle.&nbsp; This latter may
not have strictly been an advantage, as he found it difficult to resist a challenging
fight.&nbsp; His mother soon learned to keep her stock of salves and bandages full, as
beating followed brutal beating.&nbsp; However, even the lost contests brought further
wisdom, and the boy grew into a deadly warrior.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; As so many of his countrymen before him, Ashen has left his home in search of his
destiny.&nbsp; He is a nimble enemy in a fight, whirling his quarterstaff and striking
where there appears to be no opening.&nbsp; While quick to join battle, he is not
hot-headed; he fights for the love of the contest and the beauty of a well-placed strike.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Ashen has arrived but lately in the fair city of Iridine, and he is enjoying
himself immensely.&nbsp; He hopes to someday join the constabulary, as the steadfast honor
shown to him by these warriors has impressed him considerably.&nbsp; He is quick to help,
and slow to judge, but has no tolerance for those who dishonor the city through violent
crime, be it mugging, rape, or vigilante &quot;justice&quot;.&nbsp; Iridine is his new
home, and he wishes those within to treat it with respect. <br>
<br>
Ashen is looking forward to meeting you, either facing him in a sparring match, or at his
back in the midst of battle.&nbsp; Or better yet, with a mug of your posca in his hand!
&nbsp; Fare well, citizens, and remember:&nbsp; Iridine will always shine.</font></p>
