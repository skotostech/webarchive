I was born and raised in the city of Iridine, Not long ago I learnt the art of locksmithing. I am somewhat young in appearence,
but old in wisdom. I read many things to gain knowledge and new insight into myself. I am currently alone in my search, but
hope to find one who will complete my soul and bring me eternal happyness. I am not a fighter, but wish someday to gain skills in combat
just in case another wishes to fight me and I am unable to stop them from attacking me. My clothing is simple, my face
somewhat appealing, but not overly flashy. I do not wish to hold anything over another, being that I am gentle and kind.
