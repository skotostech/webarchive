  Razlin

<FONT size="2"><BR>
</FONT><SMALL>One day, as Razlin was working on his farm, he saw something
that glittered from the suns rays. He walked towards it and saw that it was
a sword. When he reached the sword, he heard screaming and yelling coming
from behind him. He turned and looked, from his house ran three hoods and
two bandits. One of the hoods, threw a torch on his house, and instantly
it went up in flames. The hood pointed to Razlin, as if to say "You're
Next!"</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Razlin could do nothing, as he was young, and only knew how to take
care of the animals and such on the farm. The hood grinned and turn from
Razlin and left with the group. Razlin fell, for his legs were getting weak,
and heard screaming from inside the house. Razlin just watched as his whole
life burned in front of him. The flames had become lower, and everything
was turning to ash, when his brother walked in from his visit to the forest.
His brother ran to his brother, and asked him what had happened. Razlin could
only mutter, for he disgraced his family by doing nothing. His brother slapped
him until Razlin came back into the real world. Razlin told his brother,
Ramuh, that three hoods and two bandits burned their house, and fled like
cowards, and now he was the coward for doing nothing. </SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Get off your arse, and learn to use a weapon. Armed combat will work
for only a little while little brother!" exclaimed Ramuh.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Ramuh grunted, and then left, saying he was going to hunt down these
vile beings. Razlin had stayed there, and now turned back to the sword he
had seen. He removed some of the brush from around it, and had picked it
up. He noticed some weird writing on it, and he could not make it out. He
turned to his house again, and devoted to seek justice for his family, and
himself. He devoted every day to learning how to use the sword. He trained
all hours, and became pretty good. He decided it was time to learn what the
lettering meant.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>He walked to a weapons dealer, and showed the man the sword. The man
smiled, and told him it used to belong to a warrior in a far off land. He
had also told Razlin that this sword is very old, and worth quite a bit.
Razlin nodded and walked out. He returned to his new home, a small lean-to
a friend had made, and sat down staring at the sword. </SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>His friend arrived, looking like a ghost, and told Razlin some upsetting
news. His brother, Ramuh, had met his death in a far off city. Razlin shed
his tears, and cursed at the sky. His friend told him, it was by the same
group that had burned his house. Razlin set out to this city.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Razlin came near the city, with sword in hand, when he was jumped
by three hoods. They beat him and nearly killed him, and had took his sword.
Lying there, bloody and barely breathing, Razlin could only let the hatred
build up. Razlin slipped from this world, into the blackness of
unconciousness.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Razlin awoke in a garden, near a strange old man. The man told him
of this city, and how to live. Razlin smirked and headed into a city full
of thieves, warriors, and con-artists. Razlin decided it was best to get
a weapon, and then hunt down the hoods and bandits. So he headed out, into
his new adventure...</SMALL>
