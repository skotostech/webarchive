<h1 align="center">Gregorius Altenius </h1>

<p><font size="2">On the night when Gregorius Altenius became a murderer, the wind wasn't
howling. Nor was it cloudy; both Aera and Lucifal were very clear in the sky. Nonetheless,
the day had been filled with evil, and the advent of night merely sharpened the feeling of
danger. Selpean Altenius, Gregorius' mother, continued to stare out the window into the
night. Occasionally she would glance back at her sleeping son and daughters. And hope that
their father would be back before sun rise. For what seemed like forever, the family held
that tableau. Sleeping children and searching mother. Her eyes slowly shut and finally,
she slept like a babe in the woods. Later on, as Lucifal was about to set, a series of
frantic knocks came on the door. She awoke with a start, and hastened over to unlatch and
unbolt the portal. As she scrambled to open the door, she hear a thudding sound and what
seemed like a sigh. Finally, the door opened and in fell her husband, with an evil looking
dagger in his back. Pinned up against the dagger was a parchment containing the words,
&quot;Go or you'll burn, your family with you.&quot; Selpean half walked, half stumbled
over to the cots containing her children. She shook them violently and they awoke, rubbing
sleep from their tired eyes. Gregorius had but a moment to grab the sturdy oak
quarterstave from above the door before following his mother out of the cottage forever. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The night wore on as the family, shortened by one, went on. Behind them
a glowing blaze marked where their formerly happy house had stood. As they walked along a
winding path through the pine forest, Gregorius' foot slipped under a root and down he
went. His fall was soundless, and for several minutes the 15 year old boy just lay there
motionless, savoring the quiet and the feel of not having to move, not having to keep
going. He was brought out of his revelry by the decided female screams of his mother and
sisters. He scrambled to his feet and ran to a small clearing, where he crouched along the
thicket near a fire. Around the fire were three men, all wielding rusty old gladii. Their
evil eyes were fastened on whatever precious goods the three travelers were carrying. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What 'ave you got, eh?&quot; the leader of the trio asked. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Nothing you'd want, you pig!&quot; Selpean cried. The events of
the night and the long walk had effected her no less than her son. Now, she saw with fury
all that was against her, and she leapt, nails flashing, at the closest henchman. Cries of
surprise showed that they hadn't been prepared for the thrust. She was able to get a
finger in the eye of one of them before the leader thrust his old sword in her side. He
wrenched it, and withdrew it bloodily from her. She looked up at his ugly face before her
eyes rolled and she fell back, dead. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Gregorius was about to burst out of the woods at that before he saw his
two sisters, standing there and clutching at each other in fright. The thought of what
these bastards would do to the rest of his family held him from his burst. He would have
sold his own life with no hesitation, but refused to risk that of his sisters. So he
watched, and waited, as the bandits fell asleep. Two would sleep, and one would stand
guard. The injured man and the leader fell asleep at once, leaving the other. For a while,
nothing happened, the man watching and the girls sitting and Gregorius waiting. Some time
later, Gregorius began to creep silently towards the man, stave at the ready. When he was
within range, he swung the stave with all his might at the man's head. It connected, a
sound like a hollow melon being thumped was made, and the man fell for the count. Quickly,
he went to check the man's pulse to see whether he was alive. With relief, he found the
man's pulse to be weak, but there. Gregorius gathered his sisters to him and told them to
hurry off along a path. Suddenly, there was a muttered, &quot;Wha's 'at, then?&quot; and
the uninjured henchman came fully awake. He spotted the fleeing captives and shook his
leader roughly. &quot;They're getting away!&quot; The bandits gave chase. Telling his
sisters to run ahead, Gregorius stepped into the shadows right off the path. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">As the henchman came galloping by, Altenius put out his stave. The man
ran full mill into the solid wood and went down, clotheslined. Kicking up his heels was
the leader. He spied Gregorius and gave a little smile to find him almost unprotected. He
snatched the gladius from it's scabbard and lunged at Gregorius, who was ill-prepared to
receive the strike. He blocked awkwardly with his stave, and had it knocked from his hand.
As the leader poised to strike the death blow, Gregorius did the only thing he could think
of- he clinched the man, getting him into a bear hug. Thinking back on every fight he'd
gotten into at home, he angled his head up a bit and, hocking back, spit on the leader's
face and took a step back. The man wiped the spittle from his face and swung the glad in
another strike. Better able to deal with this, Gregorius stepped into the scything circle,
grabbed the man's arm, ducked under the swing and buried the gladius in the bandit
leader's belly. His mouth opened once, twice, and spit forth some blood. Shocked,
Gregorius looked down at the blood that was rapidly spreading over his hands. He dropped
the hilt of the gladius and took a step back, horror washing over him at the thought that
he had killed a man taken a life. He groped around for sturdy oak quarterstave and held
it, looking for comfort in the inanimate wood. That's how the patrol of Grey Swans found
him, several miles from one of their fortresses, kneeling by the corpse of a bandit,
clutching at his father's heirloom. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The rest, as they say, is history. Gregorius Altenius trained with the
Grey Swans for three years before setting off to adventure. He entrusted the care of his
sisters to the mercenaries, but forswore their way of life. To him, the taking of life
should not be something taken lightly or done for money. So now he travels, refusing to
bring harm to another man, sometimes being called a sissy or a wuss for it, but always
resisting the impulse to fight. He remembers all to well the feeling of wet blood on his
hands.</font></p>
