<SMALL>Part I: The Longing for Adventure</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>I&#146;m Altene by birth. My family arrived there when my father was
a boy. My family was among the refugees from a war in a kingdom far to the
east of Iridine. All of us settled in a small village deep in the hills.
I grew up learning a blend of Altene and eastern traditions. When I was young,
I dreamed of exploring the world, and when I turned 16 I left my family tou
journey with my childhood friends Hyuuz, Tsubame, and Alva. We booked passage
to Blackvine, and sailed realatively uneventfully to the Republic. After
a short stay in Vetallun Village, we traveled overland to the city of Iridine.
My first night in the city, I slept in the kitchen of the Stone Toga, because
I didn&#146;t have enough money to pay for a room. The next morning I awoke
to begin my life as a resident of the most powerful empire in all of
midlight.</SMALL>

<SMALL>Now I&#146;ve been in Iridine for 3 months, and I know the city inside
and out. Currently I am between jobs, and I pass the time hunting in the
sewers. Hyuuz, Tsubame, Alva and I are still pretty close, and we often hunt
together. So far city life has been fairly good, but I&#146;m getting the
longing inside to move on, as if its time for new adventures . . . .</SMALL>
