<h1 align="center">Katerina Nuome</h1>



<p><font size="2">I grew up with my parents in the city of Iridine. My mother, Ranea, and

my father, Lonel, were caring people who raised me the best they knew how. I grew up

learning about Ereal, and fearing Ravan. Daily meditations and prayer were a part of my

life. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">One cold evening, in the 201st year of the Republic, Lonel fell ill.

Ranea stayed by his bedside constantly. One day a raven visited my home, cursing my mother

with Ravan's touch. In a fit of rage Ranea killed my father, and accused me of being

Ravan-spawned. Then she returned to herself, and told me to run. I ran, and never saw her

again. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">For 2 years I walked away from Iridine, walking about Midlight, learning

what I could, and losing the faith I once held so dear. How could Ereal let this happen to

his children? Then one day I found a Shrine where a priestess told me Ravan too had once

cursed her. She helped me restore my faith, and told me to love, not hate. She also warned

me that Ravan had his eye on me, and I should be afraid. I was. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I left the Shrine eventually, and walked back to Iridine. For some time

I fought with my hate and fear, and eventually I won. To this day I look to Ereal for

strength and love, and try to fight Ravan as best I can.</font></p>
