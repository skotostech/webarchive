<h1 align="center">Natasha Cassadine</h1>

<p><font size="2"><br>
Natasha Cassadine was born to a powerful family in Remath.&nbsp; Her father, Coban
Cassadine is a Diplomat and one of Queen Alinissa Condaia's advisors.&nbsp; Her mother,
Maxima Cassadine is a well respected Herbalist who is well known for her prize winning
roses.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The Cassadine family has been established in Remath for several generations.&nbsp; They
have always been closely allied with the House of Condaia and have gained quite a bit of
power in their own right.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Natasha was raised almost like royalty but she never felt comfortable with her position.
&nbsp; There were always expectations from her parents that she would follow in her
father's footsteps and serve the House Condaia.&nbsp; Natasha, however, had no desire to
follow in her father's footsteps.&nbsp; Being an only child the pressure to conform to her
parents expectations were too much for Natasha.<br>
<br>
The breaking point came when she was nineteen and her parents decided to arrange a
marriage for her to Lucius Solinar, a cousin to Queen Alinissa.&nbsp; Natasha decided then
and there to run off and leave her homeland so she could make her own way in the world.
&nbsp; She had no desire to marry someone she barely knew and she did not want to be a
diplomat. <br>
<br>
Natasha decided she wanted to go to the Republic of Iridine.&nbsp; She always heard
stories of Iridine and felt it was the kind of society she would be most likely to succeed
in.&nbsp; Having no appetite for violence and none of her mother's talents in Herbalism,
she decided to become a locksmith.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
She is happy for the first time in her life and hopes to make Iridine her home.</font></p>
