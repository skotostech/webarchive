<h1 align="center">Sansia Montoya</h1>

<p><br>
<font size="2">Sansia grew up in the Safelands. Not even she knows where she was born. Her
earliest memories are of her friends, at the age of 4. By that time she had become
accustome to living on her own. Living from the land around her, and wandering from town
to town, doing everything she could to help others, in return they talked to her, not
helped her or gave her any thing, for she didn't require that, all they needed to do to
get her to help them was talk to her. You see living her life in the forests, and
grasslands, was not the most mentally stimulating way to live. She needed to be with
people. She soon found a town with enough people to peek her interests. It was the town of
Taseth. The people there were nice, and constantly offered to let her live with them, she
always refused though, even in the winter. It was there that she met Josephel (bear as
they termed him), Meegan (bunny), Domina (weasel), Rath (white wolf), Heatheren (Pony),
Nif (Badger) and Twigg (Eagle), they had called her pheonix, due to her firey hair. After
not leaving the town for over a year, a group of bandits attacked the small town,
slaughtering most of the women and children. Sansia stayed hidden in the trees. Once the
men of the village managed to send the bandits running, she climbed down and helped the
Ravanite priest (the only priest in the town still alive) to tend to the wounded. All of
her friends had been killed in the battle except the Twigg, he was badly wounded
however.By helping the young priest she realized that you could never pass judgment on any
one. Also that every one has the right to live. She greaved at the loss of her first true
friends. After the wounded were taken care of, she went in search of a preist, or
priestess of Ereal. Very quickly she found Loisen, a young priestess of Ereal. Upon
returning with the young priesess she helped to rebuild the temple of Ereal that had been
disturbed in the battle months earlier. Once the powers of the gods were balanced again in
the small town she found she could no longer stay there, the loss of her friends hurt her
too much. So she set off to find a new home. She heard of Iridine as a bustling center of
commerce, decided there had to be enough people there for her to talk with, and set off to
see this famed city. Upon reaching the Vetallun cross roads she began to feel uneasy. On
Vetallun road she was attacked, not by bandits, but by the spirits of her lost friends.
The Bear, Bunny, Weasel, Wolf, Pony, and Badger attacked her senses, in essence raping her
will, and spirit. She awoke nearly dead, her long red hair, now white as ice. How long she
had layed there she could not say. She looked up and saw an old man, who told her she was
in Iridine, she asked the old fellow's name, and he replied &quot;Phaedro&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, struggling with her past, and the spirits of those she could not save, she lives in
Iridine. The spirits have managed to kill her once since she arrived in Iridine, leaving
her, where they had the time before, at the feet of the old man. She has seen friends
fall, and has died her self, and wishes that on no one else. As a means to such an end she
has put most of her effort into the Angels of the Light, a group, collegia, or guild as it
has been termed of healers. All this in hopes that others won't die due to her lack of
skill, or courage, as her friends once did...</font><br>
