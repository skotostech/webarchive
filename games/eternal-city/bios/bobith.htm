<h1 align="center">Bobith Ni</h1>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><br>
Ever since a child Bobith has hated hoods, since a Cinera hood killed his father. Bobith and Capawinius swore vengence against the Cineras. Bobith is a skilled altene swordsman, seldomly backing down from a good fight. 
<br><br>
He spent many years traveling and learning before coming upon the great city of Iridine, were after several months he was reunited with his brother. 
<br><br>
He spends most of his time on adventures or finding other things to kill. With his thin retalq gladius and shield he is a worthy adversary.
