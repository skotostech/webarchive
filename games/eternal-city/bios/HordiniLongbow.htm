<h1 align="center">Hordini Longbow</h1>



<p><font size="2">The man wept. He watched as all his home, all his memories, all his past

was destroyed by the hungry, dancing flames. And he remembered.... </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Then..... </font></p>



<p><font size="2">He had lived on his family's farm all his life. His father was a

shepherd. An Altene shepherd. This grew to dispoint his son greatly in later years, for

the young Hordini believed all Altenes should be warriors, not farmers, for he thought

farming was for the weak. When he turned sixteen, he decided to leave his home and become

a warrior. He had the build and a little expierence, for he had defended his father's

sheep with his bow and quarterstaff, and he decided to go off and become a mercenary. By

eighteen he had made a suitable name for himself, though he was still rather

inexpierenced. He decided to go home and visit his family. When he neared his home, he saw

smoke in the distance. He spurred his horse into a gallop and soon arrived. His home was

destroyed, burning, from a very recent Cinneran raid. He found his fathers body, by two

dead Cinneran soldiers, his father had a bloody gladius in his hand, and was wearing full

Altene mercenary armor. Not so weak as Hordini once thought, for his father was a warrior

in past years, but he kept this secret from Hordini, for he did not wish Hordini the same

sad life his father had had. &quot;Cowards!&quot; Hordini spat. &quot;Damn cowards!&quot;

&quot;You killed my father! An old man! It took more than two of you to bring him

down!&quot; Hordini took his knife and slashed himself. &quot;I swear I will not rest

until every bloody Cinneran is dead!&quot; Hordini could not find his mother, or brothers

or sister, and he buried his father, and then went outside to weep. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Now.... </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Hordini finished his weeping. He then began the sad life of veangence.

He took a new last name, erased all ties to his destroyed life, and journeyed to Iridine.

When he arrived, he soon found a best friend in Lanamor, a fellow Altenian, who helped him

learn how to hunt and make money by fighting. Hordini will help almost anyone in need, and

kill Cinnerans and lawbreakers without a second thought. </font></p>
