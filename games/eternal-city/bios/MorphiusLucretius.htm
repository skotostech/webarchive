<h1 align="center">Morphius Lucretius</h1>



<p><font size="2">My mothers name was Janan, and my fathers name was Eitan. They had both

met each other through their friends. For the longest time my father liked my mother,

without anyone knowing. I was told that he would usually observe her every move when she

was around, but never said much to her. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Day and night my father thought about her, though. Sometimes he'd

fantasize about actually being able to say something to her. One night it got so wanting

that he decided he'd meet her the next day after her hunting, and ask her if she'd like to

have a drink. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">So he waited, sitting in front of a dilapidated cobblestone road, which

led to rats with ambers, stones, and minerals in their stomachs which could be sold, and

hounds. As he sat there, he went through what he'd say to her, in his head. He twiddled

his thumbs, and drew things in the dirt with his feet, as he anxiously awaited Janan to

walk in from the dilapidated cobblestone. After awhile she limped out onto the wide

cobblestone road, and collapsed. My father jumped at sight of this, and removed his sack

and threw it off in the distance, and picked my mother up, and walked her all the way

along Vetallun road, to the crossroads. Then walked to Fiona. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">He then went to the bank and made a withdrawal of 4 cents, and then went

and gave them to Fiona, and asked her if she'd heal my mother. She nodded and gave him his

change, and began healing my mother. Fiona bandaged up a lot of wounds, and put a splint

on her left arm, and administered food to her. My father sat next to her, and stroked her

cheek with the back of his hand, and gazed into her eyes, and waiting patiently for her to

make a sign of returning from being unconscious. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Once Fiona healed her up, he carried her to the Vetallun baths, and set

her down, and sat there beside her, holding her hand, and rubbing it, and watching her

intently, waiting. After time passed by, she moaned, and moved to her side, and opened her

eyes, and looked up at my father, and saw him holding her hand, then she remembered what

happened. She sat up, and hugged my father, and cried, and thanked him. After they hugged

for awhile, she kissed him, and that was the start of a relationship that soon led to

marriage. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">My father joined a legion, but my mother gave up using weapons, and

became a healer. After her close encounter with death, she wanted to help prevent anyone

else from even coming close to experiencing what she did, although she didn't mind the

'awakening to my father' part at all. But she knew that not always could someone be there

to carry an unconscious person somewhere, or even drag them. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">A few months after marriage, my mother became pregnant. And several

months later I, Morphius Lucretius, was born into Midlight. My really early years were

spent either watching my dad train at Gilvens, and try and crawl out, or following my mom

while she healed people, and try to crawl away. I always tried to wonder off, but I never

did, my parents made sure of that. Glad they did now, because I can see all the trouble I

could have gotten myself into. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">As I grew older my dad took me along with him to train, and began

explaining the moves he made. I grew very fond of the Gladius. I especially enjoyed

watching my father use it. He was so graceful in his moves, and so strong in his blocks,

that I grew very proud of him, and had great faith in our legions with my father in one of

them. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">A few years later a sister was born, which I enjoyed taking care of. She

was a curious one, just like I was, so I took her to safe places to be curious, like the

gardens and some of the stores, to show her to the store keepers. I remember when she was

a few months old, and could go outside, I'd carry her to the Toga, and sit down on the

bench, and hold her, and beam happily, and show her to all that came in. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Once my sister had gotten older, she followed the footsteps of my

mothers friend, and became a locksmith. My dad bought me my first set of armor when I was

ten, and I would follow him to the forests, where he'd hunt bandits, and I'd bring the

chests to my sister, and come back. I grew a great since of direction this way. I was

amazed that my little sister, at the age of seven was unlocking chests! </font></p>



<p><font size="2">My mother continued in the profession of healing for a few more months,

but then she quit, because she grew tired, and often needed to sleep. My father had a lot

of money, so it was okay. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">A few months before I was to turn 11, my father went to war, and for

months we waited for him. The money was beginning to run out. So I packed our families

belongings, and took our family to Altene, where I rented an inn room, where my mother and

sister slept on the bed, and I set a blanket on the floor for myself to sleep. The next

morning I was up before sunrise, I purchased a Gladius, and used the skills I learned from

my father to train myself. I spent the next two days training, and resting, and training,

until I was skilled enough. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I asked a man that came in to train from the Gladius' trainer in Altene,

where the nearest dumps were. He took me there, where I remembered the spot, and then I

asked if the creatures had anything in their stomachs worth selling, in which he replied,

&quot;Yes, but you wouldn't be planning on going in there, would you?&quot; I said,

&quot;Yeah, I would. I need to make money for our family.&quot; He took me to the place to

sell stones, and I remembered that spot too. Then he went to the dumps with me, and helped

me kill a bunch of rats. There weren't any hounds here, so that was kind of nice, I was

afraid I wasn't ready for them yet. I made half a talent that day, and brought it home to

my mother. She began to cry, and looked very sad. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Mother, is everything alright?&quot; I asked, deeply concerned. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Your Uncle found us, and brought us sad news, son. Your father

died trying to save a soldier,&quot; she said, and cried some more. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I closed the door, and sat down. I stared out in front of me for such a

long time, thinking about my father, his courage. Then I thought about when I watched my

father train. I'd never get to watch him again. My sister had already cried herself to

sleep, so my mother and I were the only ones up. My mother stopped crying, and watched me

stare out in front of me, for hours. I finally looked up, and over at her. I stood up, and

moved over to the bed, and sat beside her. She put her arms around me and hugged me, and I

began to cry, for the first time about my father. Then once I couldn't cry any more, I let

my eyes rest, and then spoke, &quot;Mother, what are we going to do, now?&quot; </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;We'll have to move in with some relatives here locally, and stay

there. They don't have enough money for us, though, so you'll need to go down to Iridine

on a regular basis, and make money there. The stones here are too cheap,&quot; She replied

with a tone that wasn't happy about it. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I nodded, and pulled a blanket out of a drawer, and put it on the floor.

I changed into some night clothes, and got under the blanket, and closed my eyes, and fell

asleep. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">After being well rested, I woke up before my mother, and I grabbed half

the money I made last night, and grabbed a large sack, and my gladius, and scabbard. I put

my armor on, and my sack. I wore my scabbard, and put my gladius in it. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I grabbed the key, and unlocked the door, and opened it. Then shut and

locked it. I walked to a supply shop, and bought enough food rations to last me in an

emergency. Put them in my sack. Bought a lantern, and enough flasks of oil, and put them

in my sack. Bought a pouch, and filled it with the rest of the money I had. Then I went to

an armor shop, and bought a sagum, and wore it over my sack, and pouch, and everything

else. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I went back to the Inn we were staying at, and I kissed my mother on the

cheek, and my sister on the forehead, and left the key on the table, and put an apple on a

note, that I wrote before I left, on a piece of parchment. Then I left, closing the door

behind me, and talked with a person that worked at the Inn, to lock the door for me, from

the outside. I then began my long journey back to Iridine, and long it was. Longer than

when we came. I didn't have my sister to joke around with, I didn't have my mother to

listen to. Just the journey from Altene to Iridine, I believe, made me independent. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">A man in a hooded cloak attacked me, and threatened to kill me if I

didn't give him food or money. So I gave him all the food rations I had, and all the money

in my pouch, after realizing how tough he was. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Luckily along my path I found a fishing pole..I felt bad for who ever

left it, but I needed to make use of it, so I took it with me, and every time I saw a

river, I'd fish for awhile, until I couldn't carry any more, then that'd last me awhile. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I forgot to bring a blanket, so I was often cold at night. So I decided

I'd have to go about the dangerous way, and slept in the day when it was warm, so I didn't

get sick sleeping at night, and then at night, I'd walk, keeping myself warm by moving. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Along the way I found some children that were alone, and I beckoned them

to come with me. I kept them fed, with the fish I had. They were heading towards their

family in Iridine. They were kidnapped by Cinerans, and escaped and were heading back. I

slept less often, because I was now staying awake waiting for Cinerans, which never came

luckily, but I wasn't taking any chances. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">After a long while we finally reached Iridine. It'd been so long since I

had been there, I felt like crying. I took the children to the Stone Toga Inn, where I

gave Constantine some coins, to give these children some milk. Then I brought them to

Septima's where I bought them Chicken Dumpling soup to warm them up. I would have bought

some for myself, but I had just enough for one night for an Inn room, after that. So I

went back to the Stone Toga, and rented us a room, where I took the kids, and allowed them

to get some real sleep. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I left them there, with the door locked I wondered around going through

the tough part, as soon as I got there, rather then it coming to me slowly. I knew I had

to deal with it soon. So I went walking around and remembering my father in things and

places, and in people, and then going someplace alone to cry. One of my fathers friends

found me, and sat next to me, and put his hand on my shoulder. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Morph, you're dad is a brave and courageous man. He never let down

his guard, and never gave up. He saved my life, and for that I'm thankful. I was there

when he was dying, he told me to give you this,&quot; he said, as he offered me a tin

gladius. &quot;It was his first gladius ever. He would have'e given you his own, but some

Cinerans took it from him, but he said that this gladius' was passed down generation after

generation.&quot; </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I accepted the gladius, and replaced my other with it. I put my old one

in a large sack I had been wearing. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Thank you, Sir,&quot; I said, trying to act like I hadn't been

crying. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;He wanted me to make sure you knew that he thought you were a

strong boy, and brave, and he knew you'd be able to take care of the family, and grow to

be stronger than he ever was,&quot; he stated. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Really?&quot; I asked, happily. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Yes, his own words.&quot; </font></p>



<p><font size="2">He rubbed my shoulder, and stood up, &quot;You'll be fine, just keep

your head up, son.&quot; Then he walked away. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I pulled out the gladius I was given, and looked at it, turning it

around, watching the sun shine on it, until the sunset came. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I then got up, and walked to the Stone Toga, where I posted a piece of

parchment that said, &quot;Children Found!&quot; and gave the description of the children

I was looking over. Within days the parents knocked on my door, and I opened it, barely

moving out of the way of the excited children in time. They offered me money for bringing

them back, but I couldn't accept. Instead, I took the gladius I bought in Altene out, and

offered it to one of the boys, who had grown very curious of it, along our journey. I told

him I'd teach him once a week, if he wanted. He nodded, and beamed happily, holding the

Gladius, and pretending to be fighting. I told him to be careful with it, and then they

were on their way. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Moments after they left a loud knock on the door was heard. I jumped at

the loudness, and opened the door, and saw one of the lead men from my fathers legion

standing there. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Sir Morphius,&quot; he said, as he bowed. &quot;Your father earned

this, and now it is passed to you, since he's not here with us to accept it,&quot; He

announced, as he offered me an armillus. I accepted, and bowed back in return. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Thank you, Sir,&quot; I replied. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">He bowed again, and nodded, then did a right haste, and walked the other

direction. I closed the door and locked it, and put the key on the table, and looked at

the armillus, and smiled. I put the armillus on, and wore it. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Over the next course of 2 years, I made enough money every few months to

bring back to my family in Altene. After time the route to Altene grew more and more

manageable to me, as I grew stronger, and bought tougher armor. Soon I bought my mother a

house, where she and my sister lived, while I went to work in Iridine, killing bandits,

brutes, thugs, rats, and sold their goods. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">I then over another 3-4 years made enough money for my mother and sister

to be able to live a long while without me needing to visit, for I was old enough to live

on my own, and was far too independent to move back in with my mother. It'd be very

awkward. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">So, I familarized myself with Iridine, found myself a room in Monlon,

and I've been training with my gladius all day and night mostly, and hunting. Iridine

holds great people. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">My father gave me strength, bravery, courage, and perception. My mother

gave me responsibility, kindness, and loyalty. Midlight gave me independence. My friends

brought me happiness. </font></p>
