I was born in Iridine when my parents were passing through on a trip to Blackvine.  My parents were both natives of Altene.  We were coming to Blackvine to visit an uncle of mine, My uncle Zack.  He was an armorer who worked on a type of dagger that thieves could use because most of his customers at the times were thieves.  He put an eagle symbol on the handle of all the weapons he made.  Whenever I turned three, my parents left to go back to Altene and left me with my uncle zack to live in blackvine.  Three years later, They came back to find that I was enrolled in a locksmith training program and I was ahead of the rest of the people in my class.  My parents wanted my locksmithing skills to improve so they moved me to an apartment near the bronze lane regions.  My mother was familiar with locksmithing while my dad was a hunter.  Apula's Riverside locks was the place where I met many of my future friends and got to spend lots of time with my mom.  Although I liked locksmithing, I didn't think It was going to be my future job.  Since both my parents were from Altene, They were exceptionally good with Staves.  When I was seven, My dad got into a fight with my mom and he left her to go back to Altene.  My mother told me that he abandoned us and I was very angry with him.  One day when I got bored with studying locks, I left Apula's and decided to go look for him, I was only 13 at the time but I knew my way around Iridine.  I was walking towards the toga to get supplies for my trip when all of a sudden I bumped into a tall,dark man wearing a hooded cloak and holding a bronze-tipped stave with an Eagle engraved onto the retalq blade.  Now My Uncle Zack didn't usually make staves but I remember that he had made THAT stave especially for my Dad.  I asked the man where he got the stave.  He turned down to me, pushed me on the ground, And said that my dad was dead. He walked away and I never saw him again.  I still miss my dad to this day and I am looking for that man with the stave still today.  My mom and I grew closer and we advanced our locksmithing skills greatly.  We were very poor now that my dad was gone, So we had to move and live on the streets.  With all this spare time on my hands, I began to truly love Locksmithin'.  My mother died when I was 16 from a heart dizease.  I was truly hurt by this and I went into a suclusion of sadness. I stopped increasing my locksmithing skills and just ran around the city with my head in the dirt.  One day I met a merchant who told me that he needed a chest opened.  Now, I had lost most of my skill's, But i could still easily unlock a chest, or so i thought.  This chest he gave me took me three weeks to open because of the intracitly made lock on it.  By the time I opened the chest, The owner had been killed by a thief.  I looked inside the chest to find lots of money, a lockpick, and a note.  My mother had left this for me to continue my works in locksmithing.  To this day I am still in search of the man who killed my father, but in the meantime, I am having a great time living day by day as a locksmith in the GoL....
