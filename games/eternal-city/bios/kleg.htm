<SMALL>My child-hood was not a happy one. My parents never took notice of
me since they lost their jobs as carpenters and we became destitute. I was
a beggar, alone on the streets for seven years and then I moved to Iridine
where I am still looking for work and a place to stay. I am weak and vulnerbale
to thieves and muggers. Because of my struggle in life I turned to stealing.
I stole simple, small things, things that I could sell in order to make money.
Unfortunetley, I did not realise the law was tight in Iridine. I have not
yet been to jail but the way I'm going I soon will. So please, if you encounter
me in the street, don't hesitate to spare some change for a poor man. I am
desperate!</SMALL>
