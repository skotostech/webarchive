<h1>
Mattrim</h1></center>
<font size=-1>He was the son of a rich political figure in Altene. Mattrim
hated his father. To the Altene people he was good. But everyone who knew
him knew that Ron Cauthon was a terrible person to live with. When Mattrim
had drunk too much in the tavern where he always came, people heard him
yelling out stuff like 'HE'S THE BIGGEST HIPPOCRITE EVER, MY FATHER' and
'SOME DAY I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.' And then one day, the body of Ron Cauthon
was found in an alley. Murdered. Knife trough the heart. So called 'witnesses'
said Mattrim did it. The young man knew that he didn't, even though he
had been drinking alot the night before and didn't remember anything of
what happened. Even if it was a terrible person, it was still his father.
And the witnesses? Bought, Mattrim thought. But who? And why? There wasn't
much time to think about it. While the guards came to his room to arrest
him, he jumped trough the window and ran, ran as fast as he could. He had
always been a good runner, so he could easily get rid of the pesky guards
chasing him. But he kept on running, untill he was tired. By then, he realized
that he didn't know where he was. He was in a dark forest, overgrown by
huge trees. He continued walking on for days. Hunting and fishing and avoiding
dangerous animals to survive. After a long time of travelling, he arrived
at an inn, called the Blue Breakwater Inn. That's where he heard how close
he actually was to Iridine. Iridine, the eternal city. He couldn't believe
he had travelled so far. He thought for a while, and then decided to go
to Iridine and try to make a living there. When he arrived in Iridine,
he got somewhat lost in the chaos. It had been almost a year, since the
death of his father, that he had been in a city. After wandering around
for a while, he ended up by an inn, the Stone Toga Inn. And old man stood
there, observing him. "Hello there youngster," he said. "Hello," said Mattrim,
"I'm new here, can you help me?" And as a response to that question the
old man started to talk about life in Iridine. After the conversation,
Mattrim entered the inn, ordered a cup of tea and sat down on a chair,
thinkng about the fact that he couldn't live forever on 20 denars....</font>
