<h1 align="center">Jjike</h1>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><br>

Jjike was alone for most of his younger years and spent his time wandering between Iridine and
Vetallun. He slept on benches and in gutters and often had to beg for his food. Jjike will
always be a wanderer, searching for a life where he could be happy with what he has and what
he's done. He's a trail worn man with not very much to look forward to, and with a long road
ahead.
