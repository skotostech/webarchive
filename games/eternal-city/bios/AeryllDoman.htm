<p><font size="2">I was born in a village in Remath, the second born son to a reasonably

prosperous fabric merchant. My childhood was largely unremarkable. As the second born, I

was expected to take care of my share of the everyday chores around our shop, but was

mostly left to my own devices. My brother, Kieran, was the family's pride. Tall, strong,

handsome, clever and popular, Kieran was everyone's favourite and the apple of our

father's eye. I could never have asked for a better big brother and my fondest memories

are the times my brother spent with me, taking me on hunting trips or showing me skills he

was learning from our father. Everyone understood that Kieran would apprentice in our shop

and someday inherit our family's business and our father spent many hours with my brother

passing along the knowledge of the trade. I had no aptitude for the fabric trade, and even

less interest, and was content to live in my brother's shadow, since I, like everyone

else, loved him dearly. Everything changed the night my brother was killed in a drunken

brawl in the local tavern. He had gotten into an argument with some other patrons, an

argument about nothing of any significance, and was left stabbed to death. My family was

shattered by Kieran's senseless death, particularly my father. He seemed to have died

along with Kieran and became a cold and empty shell of his former self. Over the next few

months, I tried to take over more responsibilites in my family's business and my father

tried to teach me. However, he became increasingly frustrated with my ineptitude, and each

day, his unspoken question became increasingly louder, &quot;Why couldn't it have been

you?&quot; And so there came a day when I decided to leave my home. Remath is generally a

peaceful and prosperous kingdom, and I, in my naievete, was completely unprepared for the

hardship that awaited me. I wandered into Cinera and quickly learned some hard lessons.

While the folk of Cinera are generally decent people like you might find anywhere, the

soldiers are a cruel bunch. I was beaten frequently and most of my possessions were taken

from me, except for my staff which was of such poor quality that they considered it

worthless. The time I spent crossing Cinera is an unhappy blur in my memory now,buy I

eventually stumbled across the border into the republic of Iridine. Vetallun stands out

only as one more town where the people were hostile, another place to just keep moving on.

So I arrived in Iridine the way so many of us do, battered in body and spirit, lost and

bewildered. I can never fully express my appreciation for the kindnesses shown to me by

many of the residents of this city. To those of you who cared for me, gave me a start and

showed me how to get things done, I offer my thanks for my successes. Iridine is not

always a kind and uplifting place, but I greatly value the friendships I have made since

my arrival. I have yet to find a sense of purpose or direction, but I have my aspirations.

As to that, perhaps it is best to simply say that I am a fool who periodically flies too

close to the sun, but keeps strapping on his wings. Time will tell.</font></p>
