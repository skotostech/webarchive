<font size="2">I was born to a happy, hard working family. My parents worked hard to make
sure I was trained in what I love to do, Healing. Life was good for me. I had the perfect
family, the perfect life, and the man of my dreams. His name was Abramus. I loved him so
that I wanted to spend every waking hour with him. To my regret I often did. On one of
those days while I was with him at his home my family was attacked in their home by a band
of bandits. My twin sister, Exitt was able to fight them off with a kitchen knife, but not
before my parents where both critically wounded. I returned home that night to find both
my parents dead and my sister raving mad. From then on I vowed to dedicate myself to the
gift my parents gave me that I should have been home to use. The gift of healing. And so
began my journey to Iridine to advance my skill and save others in hopes of forgiveness
for failing to save my parents.... </font></p>
