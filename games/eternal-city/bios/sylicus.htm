<center><h1>Sylicus Andary</h1></center><p><font size="2">

Smack!!!  That was all that could be heard as the bar maid flung her hand across Sylicus's face.<br><br>"Oowww... What as that for?" Sylicus asked while rubbing his cheek.<br><br>"You know darned good well, Sylicus. How many times have I told you to leave me alone!?" The bar maid said heatedly.<br><br>"Aaww... I as just having a little fun, doll..." Sylicus said with a big grin on his face, still nursing his stinging cheek.<br><br>"Hmph!" was all that came from the bar maid as she turned around with her nose high in the air and walked off haughtily.<br><br>"Hhmmmm..... Wonder whats buggin' her tehnight?" Sylicus said absentmindedly as he searched the common room of the Blue Heron Inn.<br><br>"Hmm... Not a smart one, are you Sylicus...." Reanna said as she snaked by him, wrapping her arms around his neck, putting her nose close to his ear.<br><br>Sylicus turned around with a sudden jerk at the soft, melodic voice, and the touch of Reanna's arms around his neck.<br><br>"Havn't you harassed poor Magwen enough?  She grows tired of your childish games.  There are, as they say, bigger fish to catch......." Reanna, the Blue Heron's stage singer, said in a soft, seductive voice with an inviting smile on her face.<br><br>"Heh, arn't you always trying to pray on the weak, 'eh, Reanna?  Besides, how many husbands do you have, 3, maybe 4?" Sylicus said with open amusement on his face.<br><br>Reanna smiled back at Sylicus with both amusement and disappointment playing across her face, slowly backing away to vanish into the crowd of people and excitement.<br><br>Sylicus ordered himself another ale from a passing serving girl with a wry grin on his face and a quick pinch to her bottom.  She slapped him on the face, too, but turned around and blew him a kiss, giggled, and disappeared back into the bustle of activity.<br><br>Grinning to himself, Sylicus leaned back in his chair, and bumped into a drunken fool.<br><br>The fool roared, "HEY!! Watch where ya' put yerself, ya' lil' grunt!!"<br><br>Sylicus quickly scurried away, humbly giving his apologies.  Sitting down at another table near the stage, he watched with open interest as Reanna started her rather dramatic stage performance.<br><br>The night passed on as Sylicus watched Reanna's performance while haggling the serving girls and bar maids with pinches to the bottoms and little smooches on the cheeks, while the rattling of dice and the bustle of the common room floated around.<br><br>That night as Sylicus was returning home, he ran into a travelling merchant that was looking for another companion to accompany him on his journeys. He graciously accepted the merchant's offer, hurryin off home to pack his bags.<br><br><br>That morning, Sylicus told his mother the great news.<br><br><br>"Oh, Sylicus?" Rang his mother's soft voice.<br><br>"Yes, mother?"<br><br>"Oh, please, take care of yourself, you hear me?  I don't want anything to happen to my sweet little Sylicus.  The world is an exciting and dangerous place. One must be careful in it."<br><br>"Don't worry, ma'," Sylicus said with a grin on his face. "I can take care of myself."<br><br>"Oh, my sweet Sylicus, I will miss you dearly," she said, hugging him tightly, letting a few tears stain her cheeks.<br><br>"I'll be careful, ma', I promise.  Now, I must go before tha' merchant leaves town without me," he said with a small smile.<br><br>Sylicus bade his mother farewell.  Looking back one last time, Sylicus set out on his long, but adventurous journey with his new friend across the world of Midlight, unaware that someday he will end up in the beautifal city of Iridine.
