<h1 align="center">Commensus Livitus</h1>

<p><font size="2">Parradus and Adinna Livitus became the proud parents of Commensus in the
197th year of the Republic. Parradus, who died in 216, had held a number of important
positions in the city, having eventually risen to the rank of Senator. Adinna, who died at
the same time, was a kind mother and a well-known healer. They both perished in a fire
that burned down their villa and left their son destitute and alone. His youngest sister
and older brother are missing and are presumed to have died in the fire, as well, though
their bodies have not been recovered. The cause of the fire was never discovered, although
many have speculated that it was arson, perhaps committed by Ravanites or a member of the
undone in retaliation for Parradus' well-known campaign to rid the city of the
moon-worshippers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Commensus had grown up in moderate luxury, having been given
opportunities to study and learn from the great philosophers of the age. He was diligent
in his studies, but a few months before the fire, he had put aside his books and taken up
weapons training. At the age of 17, he wrote in his diary that he had been having
foreboding feelings of gloom and despair, and felt that some catastrophic event was
approaching that would bring bloodshed and death to the inhabitants of Iridine. The
feelings and premonitions did not go away as he grew up, and soon became the central issue
in his life. He had discussed his concerns with his father, but he was largely ignored.
When he brought them up to his mother, however, she took them very seriously and began
asking questions of her own. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The week before the fire, Commensus had left the city for training in
Vetallun, and while there, he had received an urgent note from his mother requesting that
he return to the city and meet with her. That evening, Commensus arrived to find a
blackened pile of rubble where his home once stood. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">What followed has not been well recorded. Commensus disappeared from
society for three months, broke contact with long-time friends, and exhausted his meager
bank account (his parents' wealth was based solely on Parradus' income, which vanished
with his death). He has resurfaced recently, but has not disclosed where he was or what he
has been doing for the three months he was missing. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">What is apparent, however, is that it has something to do with training
in the gladius, as he has become reasonably well-armed and has acquired some skill. He
appears normal in most respects, aside from being still deeply troubled by his loss. He
has made some recent inquiries into the death of his siblings, whose bodies, unlike those
of his parents, were never recovered from the fire. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">He appears to be entirely devoted to training, and has little time for
the events and social functions he once frequented. He now openly tells anyone who will
listen about his forebodings, and is reportedly convinced that his mother was murdered
because she was about to reveal something vitally important &#133; something about the
future of Iridine. He has said to at least one citizen that his mother's last
communication with him had to do with information she had uncovered about &quot;falling
moons&quot; and disaster. </font></p>
