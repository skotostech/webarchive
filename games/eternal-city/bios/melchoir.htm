I grew up in Altene. Raised and taught to be a warrior. Altene was pretty rough, but I always had my older buddy to look after
me. After spending several years in the army, we were one day sent on a fateful mission. When we reached there, one of our
squad members threw off his disguise and revealed himself to be a Cineran spy. He jumped me and tried to kill my with that
crooked dagger of his but then my buddy saved me. Wrestling him off of me, he and the spy got into a fist fight. As it looked
like my buddy was about to win, the spy took out a hiddin gladius and stabbed him in the heart. I cried out in anguish and
picked up the closest thing next to me, which happened to be a quarterstave, and killed the spy by thrusting the stave through is
abdomen. Ater that, several months later, I arrived in Iridine with a complete distrust of strangers and always wielding a
quarterstave whenever I could. Though quiet and distrustful, I always show my respect to people by greeting them as they
wake up. I have managed to make a few friends whom I would protect with my life, just as my buddy did for me....
