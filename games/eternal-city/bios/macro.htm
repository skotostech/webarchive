Life in general has been pretty easy for me. So far I have had none of the suffering I hear of others. I thank Ereal for that. I feel sorry for those others, however, and have dedicated my life to prevent the deaths of others to the best of my ability.<br>Coming to an understanding of my true nature took a while for me. As with most Altenes I was trained in the use of weapons at an early age. I never saw the same level of passion in me for the arts of war, however necessary they may be.<br>I cam to this pass at the age of 16, with the realisation that I must dedicate my life to the healing arts. My cousin Cadek and I would spend hours practicing our bandaging on my fathers stock of pigs *grin*. <br>My mother, Regeane, was a healer of sorts before she met my father, and has always been there for us when we would get up to our childish tricks, and injure ourselevs tree climbing.<br>My father, Lacronus, used to be in the legio, but now is making a living of sorts as a farmer.<br>My elder brother Erars, is a member of the Grey Swans. I do not envy his life, though I accept it as he is my brother.<br>My sister Capria, is married to a Legio Officer by the name of Gothra, she is sweet, and will no doubt some day bear  him good stock.<br>My younger brother Yomi is a terror. He is 12, and is threatening to come to Iridine at some point. I hope that he does not carry out his threat.<br><br>It is strange the way in which I cam to this fair city. <br>I knew I wanted to be a healer, and had been mulling over the idea for sometime before broaching the subject to my father.<br>We argued. I should have known that would happen.<br>'Why can't ya be a fighter like the rest of ya friends?', he pleaded.<br>That day I believe was the turning point.<br>I stormed off in a huff and was surprised to see a man, stumbling towards me. Bleeding, and dirty, he fell into me grabbing hold of my shoulders, uttering profanities before becoming intelligible.<br>He spoke of a fight far away, and of the need to muster the standing troops, just before falling unconscious.<br>Ripping up my tunic I tended to his wounds, and then half-carried, half-dragged the poor man into our kitchen. I layed him on the kitchen table and called out for help.<br>My father, mother and younger brother came rushing in. On seeing the man on the table my father gasped, and told me that the man on the table was none other than a Captain Lemart of the Grey Swans.<br>My mother quickly tended to Lemarts' wounds as I told my father what he had told me.<br>Leaving the house my father told me, ' You've done well, son', before running off in the general direction of the main village.<br>Yomi, with boyish curiosity was staring at the man on the table. He started to poke at the mans gaping wounds, and in result received a smack from my mother for his efforts.<br>'Do something useful', Regeane said to him.<br>My mother then expertly sewed Lemarts' gashes, and told me that she understood my need to heal. She told me I should follow my heart in all I do.<br>I have never forgotten her words, never. That is what I shall do.<br>
