<h1 align="center">Fionn Cumhaill</h1>



<p><font size="2">Fionn mac Cumhaill is 20 years of age.<br>

<br>

He was born to a working-class farm family on the isle of Windward.&nbsp; Never good with

authority, he came into conflict with his father at an early age. The details are, to say

the least, unpleasant.&nbsp; He tried and tried to earn his father's respect, but failed

miserably.&nbsp; Particularly distressing to old Conor (dad) was that Fionn was never much

for farming, and that he dreamed of greatness, of fame and great love.&nbsp; Da told him

again and again to settle for what life offers you.&nbsp; Fionn could never quite swallow

that pill, believing in his heart a man can have whatever he's got the guts to take.&nbsp;

<br>

<br>

By age 18, he was disowned and left Windward to seek a new life.&nbsp; He arrived in

Iridine a little too brave and a little too mouthy, but somehow has managed to

survive.&nbsp; Stubborn and headstrong, he has litle tolerance for those who prey on the

weak, and has occasionally had a problem with doing the constables' job for them.&nbsp;

His distaste for authority has kept him from joining the Constables or the Legion, despite

many suggestions that he should from good friends.&nbsp; He'd rather be poor than another

person's lackey.<br>

<br>

He is a fair hand with a gladius, and a good man to have in a tussle.&nbsp; He's a

tremendously loyal friend, willing to lay down his life for those he loves, and hell on

his enemies.&nbsp; He is close to few, but when he is, it's for life.&nbsp; <br>

He has recently married Livia Marcusinia..<br>

<br>

Any questions?&nbsp; Ask him.&nbsp; He'll answer. </font></p>
