<p><font size="2">&quot;Orliy, put your father's gladius down.&quot; My mother yelled. I

was always up to no good. I was only 5 when when I wanted to be a one-handed swordsman. I

always wanted to carry my own gladius around for protection. Well, me dream did come true,

but it got me into big trouble. I remember it like it was yesterday. Great, the sun is

set. Mom and daddy should be asleep, I said to myself. I crept downstaris and got the key

from under the rug. I tip-toed over to the cabnet and opened it with the key. There, my

father's gladius sat on a pillow. I picked it up and weiled it. &quot;Yes!&quot; I

whispered. I carried it outside and sat down on the front door step. The gladius sparkeled

in the moonlight. Suddenly, I heared a laugh and a brute jumped right out at me! I

screamed. Wait, I know how to use this, daddy does it all the time! I thought to myself. I

swung the gladius at the brute, but I missed. I tried again, and this time I hit him right

in the heart! Right there, he dropped dead. &quot;My first victory!&quot; I siad. My dad

came running out from the door and found me with a dead brute. &quot;Orliy, go to your

room. Your grounded for 2 months. You could of been killed. he said. He grabbed the

gladius from me. On my 12th birthday, I recived my own gladius. I guess I'm a born

natural!</font></p>
