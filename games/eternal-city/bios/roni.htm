<font size="2">My life began in a safe, middle class neighborhood in northwestern corner
of Gadaene's capital. I was an average kid, in academic pursuits and physical ability. My
father was an owner of 3 fishing boats and he often let the fishermen take me with them.
After I saw the huge neverending sea I wanted to become a sailor especially after I heard
about the magical lands beyound the horizon from our maid. However my father didn't want
me to leave home too much and wanted me to take over his business which after some years I
agreed to. When I was 12 my father took me to a knife master who tought me the basics of
using a knife. Twice a week I would go into his backyard and practice with the training
dummy. When I was 16 I got into a fight with a young man of about my age who stole a
couple of denars I saved by helping my dad carry fish to stores. Me and my knife against
him and his club I came out the winner. However his gang asked me to join them. Using my
wits and my quick knife hand I rose to the top. As I and my friends matured our gang
progressed from random beatings and petty theft to more serious crimes like fraud, and I
got caught shortly. I got lucky becuase it was right before the festival of the godess of
Love which meant I would be given a choice of getting out of the county or serving my
sentence. I chose the former because I didn't have many ties to Gadaene and by staying I
would only bring more shame to my family. I snuck on a big merchant ship and stayed there
until it came to a harbor. I got out and found myself in Moon Harbor. It was the main port
of the growing Iridine Republic that I heard about before. Delighted by this outcome of
events I began exploring the city carrying only the few posssesions I brought with me. I
had a lot of spare time and decided to improve my knife skills by hunting for rats and
osecars in the sewers of Iridine. I made a few denars by looking for tiny blue flowers
that grow in abundance outside Iridine city and selling them to the herbalist. A few weeks
ago I had a near death experience. Being too overconfident of my abilities I took on an
osecar and a rat and got beaten. Instead of running in search of a healer I stayed and
retreated only when bleeding from 3 places and scratched in many more. Outside I lost my
consciousness and only through the kindness of a nearby healer was I saved. Unlike many
people I am not searching revenge, just friends. I am poor but have enough to feed myself.
I have abandoned my criminal habbits and want to find a permanent job. </font></p>
