<center><h1>Dacanor Soulblade</h1></center><p><font size="2">

My early childhood was quite unhappy, shortly after my Mother, an Altene woman, who cooked for the bodyguards of the king of Tuchea, became pregnant with me, my Father, an Altene Bodyguard of the King of Tuchea, died, while foiling an assassination attempt on the King. They met, of course, while doing their daily jobs, and fell in 'love' as they say..<br>But it would'nt last, as, soon after I was born, my Mother remarried, a dock worker from Iridine, during the first few months, everything went fine, but then, once he became comfortable with us, and knew he had a place, firm in the family, he would get drunk and attack myself, my 2 siblings, and my Mother, I wish not to mention those names now, those were the worst of times...<br>Soon after I turned the age of 16, I was quite skilled in staves, and locksmithing, mind you, and I had set up a plan...<br>I slowly broke into my Parent's bedroom, using my lockpick, and proceeded to beat the man, my Mother had married, with my stave, the only thing my Father had left behind, a beatuiful stave, with golden caps, that he had received for foiling a previous assassination attempt on the King of Tuchea..<br>Anyway....to make a long story short, the...man....did'nt die...He had wounds, as I had beaten him beyond rrecognition, but somehow...he survived, so I ran, I ran with all my might....I finally reached Iridine, wandering around for a while....looking for food and shelter, But before I could find any, it grew dark....and wandering around at night, was not a smart thing to do....Some thugs attacked me, breaking my left arm, and then knocking me unconcious...When I woke, I found myself in a Garden, with a ma called Phaedro....everything I had, gone...My father's stave....stolen by the thugs...<br>Phaedro clothed me with some spare clothees he had lying around, and gave me some minor supplies, a few lockpicks...<br>And I was on my way, I now stay mostly in Apula's....working on my locksmithing skills, or hunting, for the day will come, when I get my Father's stave back....and use it on my 'step-father'<br>That day will come, and that, you can bet your life on....
