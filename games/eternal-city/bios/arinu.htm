Morning.<br><br>
The sun had not broken through the land to brighten up our world.<br> 
I stumbled out of my room, almost cutting myself on my wooden gladius.<br>
It was yet another day, 12 winters after I was born. <br>
My father, the delight of my eyes, waited outside, barking instructions 
at me in Aestivan. <br><br>
&quot;No! Not like that! &quot; , &quot;Watch your footwork!&quot; , &quot;You fight like our cow!&quot; as I sparred with him in front of my house. <br><br>
At the end of the day, my father drills into me what he drills everyday. <br><br>
&quot;Remember!&quot; he booms &quot; Your mother was killed by the EVIL IRIDINIANS! I am training you to help in extinguishing this menace after me!&quot; <br><br>
I nodded dumbly, not fully understanding the implications of this. <br>
Several winters later, a troop of Iridinians destroyed our village. <br>
I tried to defend it, and even killed an Iridinian in self-defense, but was knocked cold. <br>
I regained consiousness, disoriented and temporarily blind. I heard someone whisper, &quot;He will be of use to the Republic.&quot; before falling unconsious again.<br> <br>
The next thing I remember is , &quot;Hello there Youngster&quot; <br>
