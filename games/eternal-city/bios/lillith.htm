<h1 align="center">Lillith Brok</h1>



<p><font size="2">Lillith was born into a large family that lived in a small house north

of Iridine. Her mother died when she was only two years old, and her father died last

year. Both her parents were experienced locksmiths, so it was natural that Lillith would

follow in their footsteps. After their father died, Lillith's siblings all moved away to

different cities, and she came to the city to earn a living. She had little possessions,

and little money. So without any family, protection, or friends near, Lillith made her way

around the city all alone, trying to earn a living. She finally found Riverside Locks,

where she spends her time studying and helping Apula. <br>

<br>

Thanks, Lillith</font></p>
