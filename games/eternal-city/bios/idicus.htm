<h1 align="center">Idicus RingStaff</h1>



<p><font size="2">*the sounds of a door being opened hard* *A older man stares at a young

man sitting at a desk drawing on a piece of parchment with care* *the sounds of the

Parchment being snatched from the desk and a ink well being thrown across the room to

crash against the wall* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;What's this!!??&quot; the older man gestures at the parchment

while holding it into the light to get a better look at it. &quot;Another Drawing of your

my son?&quot; sneers the father at the young man. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;How many times have i told you to stop this useless Hobby

boy?&quot; growls the father. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot; I knew i should have never let you wander far from home, to think

i encouraged you to go train with Adicus RingStaff, if i would have known the only thing

you would have learned from that man was how to map, i would have never agreed to let you

receive your War Training from him.&quot; </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*the sounds of the Parchment being ripped into little pieces* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot; I am Ashamed to call you my son, for all you do is disappear for

weeks at a time and then reappear suddenly and close yourself off in this room to draw all

day long while ignoring your War Training&quot; the old man says to the young man. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;I've had enough of your ignoring your Duty and spending all this

time wandering around and drawing on Parchment all day. From this day out things will

change boy, either you put aside this nonsense and focus on your training or begone from

my house till you come to your senses and decide to join a Company and be a warrior as all

your friends have done.&quot; yells the old man. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;you have till sunrise to make up your mind boy&quot; snarls the

old man. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*sounds of the old man stalking out of the room slamming the door behind

him* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*Night slowly passes and the sun kisses the sky* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*the young man is jolted from his pondering as the door crashes open

reveling the old man standing in the doorway scowling* &quot;well boy what will it be? War

Training or Banishment from this house?&quot; asks the old man. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*Looking at the ripped up pieces of Parchment laying on the floor* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;the young man tells the old man &quot;did ya know it took me 3

weeks to make that Map Father?&quot; </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*Sighing* *the young man looks around the room and begins to gather his

belonging, grabbing his sack full of Parchment and his QuarterStave that lies next to the

door* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;I choose Banishment Father&quot; the young man says. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*A look of Shock pass across the old mans face only to quickly be

replace by an angry Glare* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;So be it boy, from this day forth till the day you come to your

senses and return to join a Company like a real Altene Warrior should do, you are hereby

Banished from my home, name and status. Get out of my house outsider.&quot; snarls the old

man. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*Chuckling at the Old Man* &quot;Thank You Father, ya don't know how

much that pleases me to hear.&quot; smiles the young man. </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*the Father raises an EyeBrow* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">*still smiling at his Father as he walks out of the house and starts

heading down the street he says over his shoulder to his Father* </font></p>



<p><font size="2">&quot;Still so many places that need Mapping&quot; </font></p>



<p><font size="2">Idicus RingStaff wandered for many years before walking into Iridine.

But his first taste of Iridine has hardened his heart somewhat to Thieves, Hoods and Mask.

Within an hour of being in town Idicus is Mugged, Beaten and Robbed of everything he owns.

Since this encounter he has developed a Hatred for Thieves, Hoods and Masks to the point

that he openly Hunts them with a passion. Always ready to give directions, aid people new

to Iridine Idicus has spent most of his time mapping everything in the City of Iridine as

well as several places around the City. </font></p>

him and talk awhile. </font></p>
