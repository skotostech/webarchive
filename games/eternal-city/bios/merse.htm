<br>
I was born in the fair city of Iridine.&nbsp; I've live with my uncle since age five when
my parents failed to return from a trip to the Aestavian League.&nbsp; My uncle was a good
and learned man, and taught me a great many things while I lived under his roof.&nbsp; He
taught me to read and write, when to use my wits rather than my blade.&nbsp; Around my
seventh year I ran errands for people of Iridine, though it was mostly shopkeepers, Tavern
owners, and occasionally a shadier variety of people&nbsp; My uncle encouraged this saying
I would get a close look at the motivations of people.&nbsp; If it was within the walls of
Iridine, I knew the best and quickest way there. After doing that for some time I grew
bored and worked at crafting from wood.&nbsp; Though I was moderately skilled, I held no
love for the work, and turned to something else.&nbsp; *grins*&nbsp; Tried my hand at
harvesting, not bad money in it...but *grins* not much excitement either.&nbsp; As every
Iridinian has I even went so far as to search out vermin in the sewers, but you might say
I just didn't have the nose for that type thing.*grins*&nbsp; During my 12yr year, I
decide to see what life was like beyond the walls of Iridne. I travelled the roads, common
and uncommon for five years, and saw many wonders like I'd never seen.&nbsp; I saw the
snow capped Blackroot Mountains, Cinerian Troops marching along the road to their capital,
dark forests with starnge creatures cries heard on the faint winds, a roaming circus with
all its brightly colored tents.&nbsp; I was still content with my nomadic lifestyle, but
one day I recieved a letter that my uncle was ill, and needed me.&nbsp; So I returned home
after all this time.&nbsp; Oh here I've said all this and never introduced myself..
