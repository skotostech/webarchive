It all started a long 18 years ago. I was born in the city of Iridine and was an unwanted child from the start. I don't know my
parents, I don't even remember having some because I was given to my aunt Elen at birth and she took me to the Parcines
where I remained until i was 16. I never fit in anywhere as a child and it's quite easy to see why. I was always about 3-4 inches
taller than everyone with blond hair and green eyes, quite a contrast for the Parcine folks. So, I spent most of my early years
alone until I met a friend name Edary Shulenko. Meeting him turned my life around and not for the best actually....
<br><br>
I became a lowly thief, and with Edary was always getting myself into trouble. From then on, my life was a mix of theft and jail
time, lots of jail time since I was rather a bad thief. I had never commited any major crimes until one day, when Edary, some
friends and I were standing in an alley. We were quite known figures in our little Parcine community but up to then, no one had
ever done anything to us. But on that fateful day, a merchant decided he had had enough and pointed us out to the Parcine
constables. They started hitting on us with their quarterstave and we hit them back to try and make a break for it out of the alley
where we were. Then it happened....a constable broke Edary's arm with his club. I turned around and heard my best friend cry
out in terrible pain. I just went mad with rage. Without even thinking, I took out my knife and plunged it between the constables
ribs. Needless to say that the other constables were not very happy to loose one of their members. They beat me up pretty
badly before bringing me to jail where I was sentenced to life in prison.
<br><br>
Fate as always been on my side and I managed to escape my cell about 3 months later. I was only 16 and on the run, fleeing
for my life. I ran into the woods and made my way towards Iridine, journey that lasted about 2 years in which I regained my old
habits of stealing and leaving pain everywhere I went.
<br><br>
I finally made it to the city of Iridine and decided turn my life around for the better. I was now 18. No more stealing, no more
pain, no more weapons unless it was absolutely necessary. Only one thing was then left for me to do...become a locksmiths. So
I travelled around town until I finally found Apula's shop, the Riverside Locks. The warm welcome she gave me (and which she
still gives despite frequent disagreements) encouraged me so I started opening coffers for citizens and I now lead a respectable
life...according to my standards at least........
