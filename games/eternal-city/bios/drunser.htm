Drunser was born on the 8th day of Palut, 193 YP. Born to a mother of negotiable
virtue, and a father who made his living breaking bones in the alleys (the
brute), Drunser had it rough during his childhood. His parents shunned him
for his elder brother, and his friends shunned him because he refused to
play their foolish and inane games. Instead, he spent his time studying
mechanical contraptions of all kinds. It was only natural that fate would
lead him one day, in his 14th year, to the Riverside Lockshop. Apula welcomed
him warmly, and for the first time, he had a family. Then-proprietor Iornos,
Apula's father, gave him bread, shelter, and a warm fire. Therefore, Drunser
was studying his locks when the Great Fire of 211 swept through the alleys
of Iridine, decimating the populations of both the rats and the poor people.
It was only his good luck that while he studied his locks in Riverside Locks,
his family burned to a toasty crisp most often associated with the grayish
ashes from a woodsman's fire. After this, Drunser pretty much disassociated
himself from his former lifestyle. Except for the odd habit, such as drinking
posca or cursing gutterally, he's pretty much done that. </FONT>

<FONT size=2>Another important thing about Drunser is his speech. His abusive
father often liked to slap him around, especially in the face area. This
permanently damaged his mouth and jaw, making him non-understandable entirely.
When Iornos took him in, he also took him to a traveling leech who performed
some surgery on him. The gravel which he inserted into Drunser's mouth made
him speak perfectly in Iridinian. Alas, that same gravel made him sound awful
in Common speech. Drunser can remove the gravel for short periods of time,
but if left out to long the jaw begins to ache. </FONT>

<FONT size=2>Recently, Drunser has formed the Guild of Locksmiths, Iridine's
largest and most productive locksmith guild ever in existence. &nbsp;Despite
a slow start and humble beginnings, this Guild shows the promise to be a
great force in Iridine in years to come.</FONT>
