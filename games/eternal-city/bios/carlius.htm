<font size="2">Thunder and lightning is heard outside the house...<br>
Inside and a discussion is held...<br>
- The boy said, &#147;You can&#146;t decide who i am, i will decide it...&#148;<br>
- The father said, &#147;Yes I can and i will... You can forget about that stave thing you
are talking about, you will be a Scholar...&#148;<br>
- The boy said, &#147;A Scholar, but i hate that crap, i want to fight with my stave, that
is what I was born for&#148;<br>
- The father said, &#147;No... You will be a Scholar, as I am and your grandfather wa...
WHAT THE...&#148;<br>
Outside the house a lightening stroke a tree...<br>
Both the boy and the father came out of the house to check for damages...<br>
- The boy said, &#147;Look...&#148;<br>
In the spot where the lightening stroke the tree there was an inscription...<br>
- The boy read, &#147;I, Ereal God of Light, have granted you your wish...&#148;<br>
Just after the boy read the inscription a quarterstave appeared before the tree.<br>
The father shocked took two steps back, stumbled and fell flat on the ground.<br>
The boy, as much shocked as his father was, approached the quarterstave, grabbed it,
wielded it, swinged it and muttered, &#147;Thanks Ereal...&#148;<br>
<br>
The quarterstave wasn&#146;t really special, it was just a normal one, what matters is
that the boy got his wish granted... Next thing the boy did was to enter the house, put
his stuff into a large sack and ran away from his home never to return... Many years
passed and the boy became a young man, he came to Iridine and began a life there. If you
want to practice with him or you just want to have a drink just give him a call he is
always prone to have new friends, either in chit-chat or in battle.</font></p>
