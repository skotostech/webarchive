<h1 align="center">Linds Freeman</h1>

<p><font size="2">My name is Lindsi Freeman. I came to Iridine when I was 18 years old.
I've learned a lot of new and wonderful things since I've arrive after having a huge
quarrel with my ex-sister Avril. Almost as soon as I settled down, I met a wonderful guy,
Antequides, whom I am going to marry soon. When I first came, I just walked around a lot,
but now I have learned how to make money and have fun. I like to help people out and
despite what some people think of me, I manage to ignore them.</font></p>
