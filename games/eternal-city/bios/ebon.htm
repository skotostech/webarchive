<h1 align="center">Ebon BlackOre</h1>



<p><font size="2">The BlackOre Clan within the Blackroot mountains is one of the many

clans charged with a solemn duty.&nbsp; Its duty is to serve the Parcine lands, and to

defend its holdings.&nbsp; All bearing the name BlackOre have been warriors stout of heart

and body.&nbsp; For generations those within Clan BlackOre have stood beside the other

various clans within the mountains they call home, and defended their lands from those

seeking to tear it from them.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

Ebon BlackOre is the latest warrior to come from the Clan.&nbsp; It is practice in his

clan that you cannot become a Seteal (Roughly translated a Defender), until you have went

upon a Jestyn.&nbsp; A Jestyn is journey that through it you test your inner mettle.&nbsp;

Most young Parcines from the clan embark on this trip around their eighteenth year.&nbsp;

Ebon, always one up for an adventure, started his on his fourteenth year.&nbsp; For one

year he wandered the plains that had belonged to his forefathers before they were claimed

by the legions of Iridine.&nbsp; He liked the plains, but felt he had more of a journey

ahead of him.&nbsp; As he travelled he encountered, a group of merchants.&nbsp; The leader

of the group, a man named Glaycin, asked Ebon if he would like to travel with them and

help guard the wagons from the bandits that sometimes ventured from the forest.&nbsp;

Ebon, no stranger to battle, agreed with a hearty laugh and a contagious grin.<br>

<br>

The group and their wagons arrived without incident to ply their wares within

Iridine.&nbsp; Ebon continued to work with the merchants for as long as they were in

Iridine, but on the evening Glaycin, and his companions left Ebon stayed on in

Iridne.&nbsp; He'd heard of this city in his travels and decided he like to see if it was

all he had heard.&nbsp; Unfortuneately, in one regard it was.&nbsp; After only a weeks

time a thief stole all the money he had earned from Glaycin.&nbsp; Ebon dealt with this

problem the only way he had been taught.&nbsp; After a fortnight of questions, sneers, and

laughter he tracked the thief to a Inn.&nbsp; He saw the man talk with another man with a

hooded cloak, they exchanged something and the thief headed out to the street.&nbsp; Ebon

was waiting for him.&nbsp; The thief turned to tell him to move aside when a flash of

recognition sparked, and he turned to go back inside.&nbsp; Ebon aimed his club true, and

knocked the thief unconious.&nbsp; Searching through the mans pouches, he found nothing

but a single denar, and a knife.&nbsp; He started to take the knife, but this was no way

for a Seteal to act.&nbsp; Instead he hoisted him onto his shoulders and carted him away

to the Constables Headquarters.<br>

<br>

He soon found a job doing menial labor around the city, mostly repairing what had been

damaged in the last battle with the Cinerians.&nbsp; He likes a good battle, or a

thrilling tale, and in the whats now been a year since he came to Iridine he's been in his

share of both.</font></p>
