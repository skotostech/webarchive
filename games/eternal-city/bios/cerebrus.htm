<h1 align="center">Cerebrus</h1>

<p><font size="2"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Cerebrus&quot;, a very strange man, appeared in town immediatly
after the occupation.&nbsp; His age is not known, but he seems to be around fifty.
According to him, as a child, he was the son of a high-ranking Cineran military officer.
&nbsp; His father would not allow him to do what he wanted to most, join the military as a
soldier, so he was knocked around from camp to camp, as a trainee.&nbsp; When his father
was assassinated, he enlisted as a soldier.&nbsp; After a few months in a
&quot;special&quot; division, which he refuses to speak of,&nbsp; he was transferred to a
fully combative unit.&nbsp; He was injured badly in his first mission, and lay on the
ground dieing.&nbsp; He passed out, remembering only seeing a man in a hood walk around
the corner.&nbsp; When he awoke, he was fully healed, without even a scar from the sword
that had passed through his heart.&nbsp; This caused his severe hatred for magic, and as
such he is an enemy of the Black Dragon.&nbsp; He wandered a bit, untill he wound up in
Iridine.&nbsp; He works as a bodyguard and a bandit hunter, and wants membership in the
Legion so he can die with honor.&nbsp; He harbors a deep animosity towards the Constables,
having spent more than his share of time in jail as a political prisoner.&nbsp; Cerebrus'
name is not known, though you could always ask. :)&nbsp; Before he dies, he wants to find
the man who killed his father, and kill him.&nbsp; He would appreciate any help anyone can
give in finding that mans identity. The man will never be found... Cerebrus was killed in
a rebellion on January 7 1999. </font></p>
