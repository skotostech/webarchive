<center><h1>Mestanes</h1></center>

<br>

<p><font size="2">
Mestanes grew up living in the harsh lands of Altene. He was the bookish sort, always meek and unsociable. His peers would
always make fun of him since he was considered as the "lowly peon". As he reached his 21st birthday a group of masks
mugged and gagged him. After a grueling sleep he awoke to find himself tied up in the sewers. Minutes crawled by like years as
he tried to untie his mangled self. Once he had ridden himself of his shakles he set off to find the exit of the sewers. Weeks went
by, as he spent his time living in the sewers. However because of this he learned how to fight, how to improvise, and most
importantly, how to survive. Mestanes escaped, a strong, fierce man (with his broken glasses). He set off to train in the fighting
arts. He longs to this day to become a constable and finnaly rid the city of the masks who had hurt him, mind and body, that
deadly 21st birthday...
