I was born in Sostaeran to my mother, Eiadh, and father, Elemak, with an older sister, Eilet. A few moments later I had a younger brother too as my twin Oran was born. My father died in a rare sailing accident when I was 13. My mother had to take up a skill to keep us alive. We lived nearby a locksmith shop and she figured it was a good place to start. Naturally as she was only starting locksmithing and we had to support four people the rest of us had to work to. My sister went and helped the healers; my brother joined many of the other boys and began training with a weapon and sailing. I, on the other hand, never felt much of a need to fight and have a slight dislike for water. I went ahead and joined my mother at the locksmith shop. After about a year of this when we were all just getting settled my sister died from a disease she caught tending to a man none of the healers knew how to heal. After losing my father and older sister in such a short time I was devastated. I began to differ from the rest of my countrymen ever more. I stopped being serious about anything trying to deal with my losses. My mother couldn&#146;t take it and her health began to deteriorate. My brother and I had to do more and more work, as she was able to do less and less. When I was nearly twenty and getting fairly good at my skill one of my mother&#146;s best friends died in a border skirmish with Gaedene. She just couldn&#146;t take it any more and jumped into the bay, she had never learned to swim. My brother wanted to get away from Sostaeran for many reasons including the loss of our family and I needed to leave because of that and my complete deviation from all that is expected of a Sostaerani. We moved to Iridine hoping to start a new life. My brother got homesick and wasn&#146;t doing very well anyway and moved back to Sostaeran. I had set down roots and wasn&#146;t leaving. So here I am now trying to make ends meet. The rest of the story has yet to be written...
