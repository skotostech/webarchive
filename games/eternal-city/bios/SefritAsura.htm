<h1 align="center">Sefrit Asura</h1>

<p><font size="2">Hi , my name is Sefrit Asura. Not the greatest name in the world.
Personally I would have preferred a better name , and speaking of names , that's the
reason I came to Iridine. To make a name for myself. I was born in Windward , not the
greatest place to live, but we all called it home. Dad was a miner , mom stayed at home.
We weren't exactly rich , no sir , far from it. Life in Windward was a little on the
boring side. I dreamed of going on fantastic adventures, all much too far away from
Windward. Everyday I wanted more and more to be a warrior , but my father said my fate was
set , I would start mining within the next three months. It was for more income , and so I
could have a family of my own someday. When a group of travelers passed through , they
showed a certain interest in our town. Of course they were Tucheans , you would see lots
of Tucheans in Windward , considering it was Tuchean owned at one time. They rode off
without a word , and were gone by the time you could say &quot;Tuchean invaders&quot;.
Sure as the hair on my chest they were back the next day , this time with many warriors ,
they advanced on the town , some with bows others with gladius. Already the men of our
town sprung into action , attacking with mining picks , shovels , some men even brought
out gladius. I know you're thinking they're just Tucheans , the worst aim in the world ,
and the most poorly trained. It must have been a stroke of luck because as soon as my
father and mother left the porch of my endangered home , they were hit square in the chest
and in the throat. My father was killed instantly , my mother left for dead , her last
words (spoken to me) were &quot;Under....the....floorboard...bedroom&quot; Instantly I
rushed into the house , searched under the floorboards , there was 20 denars , a knife , a
large sack , and a spear. I stuffed them in the sack , grabbed a few rations from the
table , and fled from my hometown as a coward. You can call me a coward , but words never
made a man. I hopped onto a ship bound for Iridine , and here I am. I recieved spear
training from Gilven , he's a kind fellow. I've been living in Iridine ever since.</font><!--webbot bot="FormInsertHere" DESCR="The FrontPage FormInsertHere Component indicates the point in an HTML file where you want a default, Registration, or Discussion Component to insert new results." startspan --><!--webbot bot="FormInsertHere" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>
