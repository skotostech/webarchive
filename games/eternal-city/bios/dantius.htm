<center><h1>Dantius Malius</h1></center><p><font size="2">

My name is Dantius Malius, and I am a Cineran.<br><br>Some people hate me because of this fact.  I don't blame them.  I hate all Cinerans, including myself.  The one exception is Irrikus, whom I met after I came to Iridine, and is my one friend.<br><br>But I am getting ahead of myself.  I was born to a family who had strong ties to the Cineran military, so it was assumed that I, too, would join.  My father was the most demanding, enrolling me in military training when I was only three.  However, I did not speak out against this.  I was resigned to the fact that my dad expected only the best from me.<br><br>When I was 12, I was placed in a company within the Cineran army.

They said that I was trying to ruin the family name, so I did the only thing I could.  One night, after everyone was asleep, I took my dagger, snuck into the officer's quarters, and slit the pervert's throat.  Then I ran.  I ran as fast as I could, for as long as I could.  The only things I had were my clothes and my knife.<br><br>For several years, I journyed through the wilderness.  I didn't know where to go.  Icouldn't show my face in Cinera, and the Republic had been occupied.  Then, one day, I heard someone on a nearby road say that the Cinerans had been beaten back out of the Republic.  With the end of the occupation, I could finally find sanctuary.  I gathered what little things I had, and made my way toward the Eternal City, Iridine...
