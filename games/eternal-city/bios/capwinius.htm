<h1 align="center">Capwinius Ni</h1>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><br>
Born to the house wife, Diane, and Mercenary warrior, Arthur, 
Capwinius(cap for short) was raised in Altene where he learned the art of 
staves as a young child. Slowly improving in staves as he grew he also 
started to grow tired and dreamed of being a swordsman like the ones in the 
stories he hears from Iridine. At the age of fifteen his father was killed 
helping the legions fight against the Cinerans. He was devestated by the 
news and vowed to go to Iridine and help the legions defeat the Cineran 
bastards. On his 16th birthday his uncle had heard of his vow and decided 
to help. Over the next two years his uncle trained him in the art of 
swordsmanship. When he was seventeen Capwinius set out to go to Iridine. 
He brought both the stave his father had given him and the tin gladius 
his uncle had still not sure which one he'd rather use. 
Upon reaching Iridine he was taken back by the sheer size of the city.
It was nothing like the small town he grew up in. After exploring a bit he 
decided he liked the gladius and thus he slowly forgot how to use the 
staves as his fathers and forefathers did and grew better in the gladius. 
Even though he had forgotten how to use the stave he kept it to remind 
himself of his vow. After a month or so of fighting in the allies and 
sewers he finally got his chance to make good on his vow when it was 
announced that the legion was recruiting. He showed up to the recruitment 
full of excitment and pride that he was actually going to be able to make 
good on his vow. After being yelled at a bit by Wallace and the other 
officers he got his chance to sign up and is now awaiting the next battle 
to prove himself as an legionare.
