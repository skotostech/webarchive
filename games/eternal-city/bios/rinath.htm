<h1 align="center">Rinath</h1>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><br>
Born in the small town of Monlon, Rinath grew up as a normal child. His parents both loved
him greatly and would do anything for him. As Rinath grew up and became a teenager he
began to argue with his parents, especially his dad. Always very much like his Father head
smart and stubborn, they butted heads often. His father serving in the Legions prepared to
go out on patrol to remove a few Cinerans from the Iridinian border. Rinath yelled at his
father and told him he wished he would just die. His father did die that very night, as
one of his patrolmen betrayed him to the Cinerans. Rinath was devastated the most and
began to hate himself. He awoke one night and grabbed the spear his father had made for
him and walked out the door.<br>
<br>
He traveled for along time never really sure where he was going. He soon found himself in
Cinera, and a nice man took him in. He made friends with a few of his neighbours and even
fell in love with a very attractive girl his age. It was about this time the Second
Iridinian-Cineran War was being planned. Cineran Soldiers began to hunt for any Iridinian
born people to excute them. Rinath wasn't afraid because he really trusted his friends. He
even had started to feel better about his father, when he heart once again was ripped from
his chest. His girlfriend and future wife betrayed him to a young Cineran Commander.
Rinath managed to evade the Cinerans and once again was wandering alone with only his
spear.<br>
<br>
He soon arrived near some high mountains and decided to go over them just in case he was
being followed by anyone. He made it to the top and found the cold mountain air to great
for him to withstand and collapsed. He was awakened by the sound of hungrey wolves
preparing to make a snack out of him. He grabbed his spear and killed over 10 of them, and
skinned all of them. Eating their meat and making a coat from their skins, and he made it
down the mountain. But at the bottom of the hill he meet a group of Blackroot Barbarians
who gladly took advantage of his weakened state. He suffered a broken leg,a broken arm,
and 3 broken ribs. He feared his pathetic life was over.<br>
<br>
He somehow managed to get to his feet and walk away from where he was left for died. He
soon found himself in a forest, were once again alone, managed to survive. He would look
up at the sky during the day and curse the sun and at night curse the moon. He felt ever
god ever believed in had turned their backs on him. After recovering for 2 months, he had
enough strength to march on. He meet a Parcinian War Party and was chased to a very fast
moving river. He decided his chance were better with the river then the clubs they carried
he jumped in. He began to struggle and found no oxygen to enter his lungs. He blacked out
once again, but this he even shocked himself. Instead of cursing everything around him,
his only words were,&quot;EREAL SAVE ME!&quot;<br>
<br>
He felt himself pulled up on dry land and when he opened his eyes he was laying in a
remote temple to Ereal. He found himself to be in Blackroot, the home of the famous
barbarian hordes. He discovered this temple was dedicated to civilizing them, and that
some were even becoming better men then the people of Monlon's upper class. He was able to
once again regain his strength and his skill with the spear was harnessed to perfection.
Waving goodbye to his first true friends of the Priest and Barbarians he set out for home.
He made the long journay without trouble, and was safely back in Vetullan. He made sure to
directly avoid his former home, because his mother had died during his long trek. He now
seeks the girl he once called &quot;lover&quot; and the young Cineran Captain. Having
learned the military tactics of the Cinerans, the strength of the Barbarians, and the
wisdom of the Priest of Ereal, he readies himself for any challenge. He plans to follow
his father's footsteps and become a Hero for Iridine and is always ready to attack any
Cineran Patrol hoping against hope to meet his enemy for that one final combat were he
proves he is the best warrior of the Trijan Community. </font></p>
