<h1 align="center">Sernak Jernstum</h1>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><br>
Sernak Jerenstum was born of noble Altene blood. Having been raised in the 
ways of the Altene, he was taught the use of a stave. Sernak took a great 
liking to the weapon, and quickly became good at it. Upon arriving to 
Iridine the 19th year of his life, Sernak found that a great evil had began 
to take the city. He aided the Priests of Ereal in their battle against this
force, and some still know him for his bravery that night. As time passed, 
Sernak felt out of place in the city. He purchased a hooded cloak and spent
nearly every waking moment battling the rats and osecars that populate the 
sewers of Iridine. He quickly gained friends, and loyalty. Before long,
Sernak had become rather good with the stave, and decided to spend his 
days battling at the dumps. Many a day passed as he fought alone there, and
many a denar earned by selling the many pelts and stones he gained. Sernak 
was making a successful living. Before long, Sernak had become Capable, in 
the old ways of ranking, and took it upon himself to help control the bandit
problems near Vetallun. Many a friend did Sernak gain, and he had become
wealthy, but he was still distraught. The injustice within the city of 
Iridine displeased Sernak. He seen the abuse of power in the Constablary,
 and sought to fix it. He began organizing a group of his greatest friends,
 and some of the greatest warriors known to Iridine. All seemed to be well 
in the way of upholding Justice, but something beyond his control caused 
Sernak to have to sleep for a great time. Upon returning, he found things
 in Iridine to be much better, and the Constablary was honorable once again,
and with it he had lost his place. Hearing about an organization called the
 Conclave, Sernak sought a place for himself. A member of the Conclave, 
called Raynor, was beaten and stolen from by a man named Infinitus. 
Sernak was informed to aprehend Infinitus and get Raynor's belongings
 back. He passively confronted Infinitus, who would not comply, and a 
brawl broke out. Sernak was then double-teamed by Magestica and Infinitus,
 but due to his superior stave skilles, he managed to hold them off, and
 weaken Infinitus, who would not comply to justice. During the course of 
battle, Sernak fumbled his stave, and the dishonorable Infinitus grabbed it.
 Unable to defend himself, Sernak left. He later requested that he get his 
sturdy oak quarterstave returned, as well as Raynor's things. When Infinitus 
refused, Sernak again took physical action, but ignorant bystanders felt
 they needed to defend Infinitus. A party of Aestro, Magestica, Atua, and 
Infinitus brutally slaughtered Sernak at the dumps, and he never breathed 
again.
