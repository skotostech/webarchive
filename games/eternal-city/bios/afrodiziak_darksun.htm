<h1 align="center">Afrodiziak Darksun</h1>

<p><font size="2">The first years of his life are a bit shady. The only visions of his
childhood are the sounds of a woman's voice calling a name he does not know, and the
painting of a knife with a red tinge to it. He was raised by his uncle, who also renamed
him Afrodiziak, in the harbors of Iridine. The name is taken from his ability to dream and
prophesize his own future and the futures of those around him. He has no known memory of
his given name, and no memory of his parents. All he knows is that he has small visions of
the future but would trade it all for the knowledge of his past. </font></p>
