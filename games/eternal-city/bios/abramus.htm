I was born in the Republic of Iridine and traveled extensively till I met the most
beautiful women I have seen. Her eyes as pools of water, a heart like a dove, and a
personality like a breath of fresh air. Her name was Sarai Agape. I had won her heart and
thought I would have eternal happiness, but Alas, it was not to be. On the night I was to
propose her parents were attacked and slain by a group of bandits. She then gave her soul
to the spirit of grief and broke my heart. Now I have vowed to give my life to wiping out
bandits wherever they may be and one day winning back Sarai's heart from the spirit of
grief. And so began my bandit chasing to Iridine.... </font></p>
