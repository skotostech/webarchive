<FONT size="2"><BR>
</FONT><SMALL>You walk through the entrance to the gardens. Instantly, the
sweet aroma of flowers, the songs of birds, and luscious green of trees and
plants overtake your senses. You feel complete euphoria envelope you as your
leisurely stride takes you around the path.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Up ahead you see a bench. Sitting on a bench is a you, scrawny man.
His hair is bright white, nearly a match for his light blue eyes that peek
out from under his bangs. His face forms a wonderfully cheering smile as
he looks at you. Just looking at him, you can tell he fits in here. The plants
and flowers all seem to be made of the same thing as he is. He seems to be
in his environment. Peace and happiness flow through you as you get closer.
You cant help but to let loose a childish grin of pleasure.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>The man motions for you to sit next to him, and without even considering
otherwise, you do. He is as silent as the trees themselves as you both sit
and watch the gardens. The gardens are filled with a fog of tranquility that
soaks into you. </SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Finally, he speaks.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"This is my home," he states. "I was born here and have been raised
by the gardens themselves. I heal those that need my help, and I pass on
happiness wherever I go. Tell them about me. Remember me. In this harsh world
called Midlight, there is nothing to trust. Nothing, except me. The gardens
birthed me and I am here to spread their peace. Now go, go and be
happy."</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>You walk away, smiling, not paying attention to where you go. And
deep inside you know, you will never be the same.</SMALL>
