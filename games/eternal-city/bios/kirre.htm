*Looking up from his book as he sits in the padded cushion chair in Stone Toga Inn*<br>Hello, I'm Kirre, my name's pronounced Kir-re just incase you thought otherwise.<br> I'm new to the city streets, only been in it a few months before I had to leave on a journey by sea but I'm <br>back for good.  I'm good guy at heart, a roque by nature and a fighter by skill.<br>I was born on a ship going to some foreign lands before it was ship wrecked a few miles from<br>Iridine where I was picked by a healer and then raised at the Hospice most of my life.<br>I would of become a healer but my talent is in fighting so I was let go into the world.<br>And here I am.<br>
