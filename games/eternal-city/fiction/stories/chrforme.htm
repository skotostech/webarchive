<center><h1>Cheer for Me</h1><p><font size="2">By Drexus Creshiando</center><br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

I am free, yet I fight among slaves.<br>For lack of the desire I could sail the world,<br>But that would not sate my thirst.<br><br>I fight for the glory, for recognition,<br>While most of my brethren would fight for life itself.<br>My desires are simple, Cheer for me.<br><br>Sadistic some would say,<br>An unnecessary fight they would call it.<br>But no, I am truly gentle in person,<br>For my life as well is in your hands.<br><br>True my flesh will not taste of Ravan's grip,<br>At least not in the Colosseum, I am paid for,<br>And I am too big an investment to simply die.<br><br>But should I be hated, should my skill be lacking, <br>I will disappear from the Sands of my desire.<br>No longer will I hear the roar of the crowd,<br>I will lose all purpose, and thus I will die.<br><br>My soul lies on bloodstained sands,<br>That is where I am truly alive, and so I ask,<br>That it would let me battle for but one more day,<br>Cheer for me.<br><br>~from the private journals of Drexus Creshiando, written upon achieving his dream of becoming a gladiator~
