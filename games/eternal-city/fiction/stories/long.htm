<p><font size="2">Blood ran down Rinath's body as it mixed with sweat and rainwater.
&quot;This isn't how I planned on dieing,&quot;Rinath said to himself. He stared at five
warriors and the two he had already managed to kill. His spear shaft had almost snapped
twice under the great wieght of the many gladius. He had turned from a full fledge battle
to a simple staring contest. Rinath could feel himself blackening out as he tried to stay
awake.&quot;This is really bad!&quot;thought Rinath dodging an attack and swing his spear
hoping to draw some blood. With every breath he found it harder and harder to stay on his
feet, he knew the end was near. After surviving so much,you got to go sometime.He jumped
back up to full alertness as two women jumped from behind him. One carried only a simple
quarterstave, the other a gladius and a shield with a skull on it. he watched as the two
women made short work of the five fighters, leaving none alive. Then they turned to face
him.&quot;I didn't ask for your help!&quot;exclaimed Rinath in a very harsh
voice.&quot;This was our war before you started meddling around in it,&quot; cried the one
woman carrying the shield.&quot;You had no....no...n,&quot;studdered Rinath as he fell
down with a thud.&quot;Men,&quot;said the woman with the quarterstave as they carried off
Rinath. </font><!--webbot bot="FormInsertHere" DESCR="The FrontPage FormInsertHere Component indicates the point in an HTML file where you want a default, Registration, or Discussion Component to insert new results." startspan --><!--webbot bot="FormInsertHere" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>

<p><font size="2">Rinath awoke and almost jumped from the cot he was sleeping in. He
immediately reached for his spear, and found it no where.He then studied his surroundings
and found himself in a tent with a few healers tending to the wounded nearby.He jumped to
his feet and grabbed one of the healer by their robe.&quot;Where are my
weapons!&quot;cried Rinath, scaring the healer.&quot;Didn't you know weapons aren't
allowed in hospices,&quot; came a voice from the enterance to the tent.Rinath turned to
face him and found the two women he had meet before right beside of him.&quot;Return my
weapons, I must be on my way,&quot; said Rinath annoyed with this whole thing. The man
snapped his fingers and a servant brought in the small sheath that held his dirk and the
spear his father had made for him.&quot;Why were you crossing through our
lands?&quot;asked the man.&quot;I am traveling from Blackroot to Iridine and was told this
the quickest way,&quot; said Rinath.&quot;You are right this is the fastest, but we are at
war with another community here,&quot;said the woman still carrying the shield.Rinath
looked puzzled, til he saw all around him, every person here had a skull somewhere on
their bodies.&quot;What other communities?&quot;asked Rinath still not sure of the whole
story.&quot;We are called the Trijan Community, translated into your Iridinian toungue
Order of the Skull.A rival community is battling us for this area, you were caught up in
our battle,&quot;said the man.&quot;Ok, I see now but I don't think I should get
in...,&quot;Rinath's words were cut short as a loud trumpet sounded.&quot;To
battle,&quot;cried the man,&quot;the enemy is upon us!&quot;Rinath followed them outside
to see what was happening. Sure enough there was a large force of men and women headed
toward the camp.&quot;Here we go again,&quot;thought Rinath as he wielded his spear. He
watched as man and metal clashed, Rinath decided joining the action wasn't a bad idea so
he charge into the men. Rinath killed three men before recieving as much as a scratch, but
was being outnumbered very quickly. Hearing a cry Rinath turned to see the man from the
tent being knocked down and his enemy raising his weapon to kill him.&quot;Don't think
so,&quot;Rinath cried as he rammed his shoulder into him knock him down, and then killing
him with his spear.&quot;Thank you, you saved my life,&quot; said the man as he stood to
his feet.&quot;My pleasure,&quot;said Rinath turning to face his other opponents.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*****************</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The battle raged on for about an hour and Rinath's spear was dipped in
alot more blood.But the Trijans won the battle and Rinath was told had definately crippled
their enemy. &quot;You did a fine service, and I feel you must be told that you may from
this day forward call yourself a member of the Trijan Community,&quot;said the man, Rinath
learned was their leader.&quot;I will live to deserve the honor, but I can not stay here,
I must travel onward to Iridine,&quot;said Rinath.&quot;I have taken that into
consideration and have realized that in Iridine you would be the only Trijan there. So I
decided that Anex and Kitana, your two friends from your first battle here will accompany
you,&quot;said the man motioning to the woman with the shield and her companion.Rinath
shrugged as he waved to the man.&quot;You can come, but you have to keep up,&quot; said
Rinath to Anex and Kitana.&quot;Like that will be hard,&quot; said Kitana jokingly.
&quot;You know we have a long ways to travel from here to Iridine, and will probaly be on
more adventures then you can count on your fingers,&quot;said Rinath as he marched out of
the small collection of tents.&quot;I'm up for it, what else is there to do?&quot;asked
Anex as they walked side by side.&quot;You do know where were going right?&quot; asked
Kitana.&quot;Yeah, well get there some day,&quot; said Rinath and he and the women marched
foward, with one destination on their minds.</font></p>
