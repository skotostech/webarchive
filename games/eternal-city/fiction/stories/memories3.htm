To the healers; Iridine wouldnÌt survive without them.
<br><br>
Andrius found himself in a large tent. The buzz of flies seemed ever present along with a lingering smell of which he could not
seem to distinguish. He looked around himself and noticed he was among beaten men, all moaning or screaming in horror as the
healers attempted to remove destroyed limbs. Andrius stumbled over to one healer, who was just washing off her hands. She
placed down a bundle of bandages and looked up with a tired face. She managed a brief smile and stated, ÏMy oh my, your
arm, that looks like a terrible wound.Ó Andrius, still in shock over his current circumstance, gave a confused nod, as if he
seemed to know not what the healer was talking about. He grasped his arm tightly and said, ÏIs there anything you can do? My
arm has been bleeding and I am very tired.Ó
<br>ÏWell,Ó the healer replied, ÏitÌs my job to patch fellas like you up now ainÌt it?Ó
With that, she helped him over to a bed, which had just vacated by some poor soul. She began to examine his arm, taking off
parts of dead skin and waving away flies as she did. She took a small vile of liquid and poured it on AndriusÌ arm. He squinted
a little, just enough for someone to notice that he felt some pain. She then dug through her bag and got out a small iron bar of
some sort. She put in AndriusÌ mouth and said, ÏHere, bite down on this.Ó She then pulled out some stitches and a needle and
began to stitch the wound shut. With this, Andrius began to moan a little and bite down hard on the small iron bar. He clenched
the fist on his good arm and then opened it only so he could grasp and clench down on the bed. ÏNow, all done.Ó The healer
announced with a smile. ÏThat didnÌt hurt so much now did it?Ó Andrius, with a frown just gazed through her and then relaxed
against the rough pillow and spit out the bar.
<br>
ÏWell, IÌll just put on these bandages and youÌll be all set. Just rest here and weÌll get you some water.Ó The healer, in the
middle of patching up Andrius, said, ÏMy name is Luminaeus. What is yours?Ó
With a slight murmur, Andrius responded, ÏAndrius Pompeii.Ó
<br>
Luminaeus responded, ÏNice to meet you Andrius.Ó With a smile of satisfaction she stated, ÏThere all better. Try to be more
careful next time, or youÌll have to come see me again.Ó With that, she walked off to the next patient, and began the same
routine. Andrius, tired from his days exploits, was pale white and extremely dirty. He pictured his friend, from the moment they
met in the Academy. Sparring together, playing jokes on the younger members of the Legio in later years, but mainly walking
around the streets each day, carefree. He wondered what it would be like if they had simply gone to lunch that day, no battle,
no Cinerans, no death.
