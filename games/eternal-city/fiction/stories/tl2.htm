</FONT><SMALL>Night and Monlon seem to be approaching at the same time. Mumbling
as I fumble around in my sack looking for a torch. Finally resting my fingers
on a lantern I stole a long time ago, I take it out and light it, it's light
making me wince and pull away. I learned along time ago that light makes
you an easier target for people to see you. It also takes a bit of time to
adjust your eyes to the light and darkness. I like being part of the darkness
and not the light.... I watch my thoughts and wonder if the city is breeding
stupid and ignorant people or if I have just not been around people for too
long. As I walk into Monlon I see 4 men with gladius already drawn and they
are looking at me through the pouring rain, and I know that they are not
just waiting for a friend. I pull my hood closer around my face and when
I go to move past the man, he pushed his gladius against my right arm. I
calmly rest my hand on my dagger, while looking around for an exit... just
in case.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Sir, where are you off to?" says the third man.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Just to my room" I grunt.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Over our dead bodies" says the one with the gladius pointed at me,
and than he lunges at me, but I calmly sidestep his attack.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>While the third is drawing his gladius, the second man takes a spear
from his sack. I sneer at this gladius, gladius, and spear against my dagger.
I jab at the first's face, scoring a lucky critical hit, and I hit two more
times before he strikes again. He misses me. When the man with the spear
fumbles his spear, I take it calmly and laugh at them all.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Lets see if I still remember how to use this" and I approach the
third man. I impale this man quickly twice, while the first gladius starts
to approach me again. I leave the spear in the second gladius man, and I
turn again to the first gladius. He snarls at me and I start a bunch of hits
to this mans face until he falls. The man who was wielding his spear, is
thinking aloud, just trying to get help. I search over these man, grab some
weapons and their sacks and with an evil laugh, turn to the Inn. Taking the
key from my pouch and unlocking the door, I laugh, for this day was much
more exciting than the normal day for me. I stretch out on my bed after
distributing my new items in my room, than going to sleep. Tommorow is a
new day.....</SMALL>
