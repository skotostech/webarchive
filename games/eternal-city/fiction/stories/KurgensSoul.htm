<h2 align="center">Kurgen's Soul</h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Long47</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Kurgen had wandered the forest for 3 days now. He had about 2 hours
sleep between the three days and had only small berries to eat from time to time. He
hadn't felt right ever since he had re-activated the sword and cloak, he hadn't looked at
his weapon since it was placed back in its sheath. &quot;Look what we have here,&quot;
said a slender man stepping from behind a rock. &quot;Looks like a weak old man,&quot;
boomed a voice from behind Kurgen. Kurgen noticed three other men step out to his sides,
but his attention was more drawn to the puddle infront of his feet. In it he saw a man
that had a very sad expression on his face, his darks eyes will empty and his once
midnight hair was showing signs of white peeking through, all over him was signs of old
age. &quot;Don't do this, I have no money with me and you'll only be hurt. I don't want a
fight,&quot; said Kurgen slowly, even his voice showing signs of age instead of the once
confidently,powerful,boom. &quot;I like the old man's cloak myself,&quot; said the large
booming voice. &quot;I like that simple green gladius,&quot; said the slender man infront.
&quot;Fine,&quot; said Kurgen with a sigh and he drew his gladius. &quot;BATTLE-AXE,&quot;
yelled Kurgen, but even his yell lacked its ussual power. The gladius did answer his call
and its form began to change, though Kurgen could feel the inner pull. Kurgen launched it
after that and with magical accuracy it removed all of their heads. Kurgen picked it up
returned it to its gladius form and slide it into its home.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">******</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Kurgen is in inner turmoil Dycrus, he is questioning himself and
his right to wield the gladius,&quot; said the old man slowly. &quot;I see, tis not his
fault. He will eventually learn his role and that of the gladius. A messanger does not
fufill the message he was sent to do, he delievers it.&quot; said a divine voice with
power. &quot;He has finally noticed how old he has gotten, his troubles have finally began
to show on him physically,&quot; said the old man. &quot;It was deemed by us at the
beginning of time man didn't deserve immortality unless he earned it. Man is too chaotic
and has trouble understand both sides to the same story,&quot; said the divine voice from
no where. &quot;I guess you are correct, it is a shame Kurgen will not accept help for
this problem,&quot; said the old man.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*******</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Kurgen sat near a waterfall, his heart had brought him here for his
answers. &quot;Ravan sends his best,&quot; came an unhumanly voice as Kurgen barely dodged
a club. &quot;Well I'll send Ravan's servant back in the best box I can make,&quot; Kurgen
laughed as he pulled out his gladius. &quot;Why would you use a box?&quot; said the large
creature. Kurgen shrugged as he looked at it, Large and fat with one eye and no hair, it
wore only a loincloth and wielded a cheap club. &quot;This is easy, SPEAR!&quot; yelled
Kurgen as his gladius took its form. He aimed and then launched it at the creature's eye,
and magically it rang true and went into the eye and through the brain. &quot;Obviously
these creatures are stupid,&quot; said Kurgen retriving his gladius. &quot;Yes, but there
are many in this world,&quot; said the voice of an old man. &quot;Finally you show
up,&quot; said Kurgen shaking his hand, holding back the urge to hug him. &quot;Your
answers lay inside my friend,&quot; said the old man pointing towards the small cave
behind the waterfall. Kurgen only nodded and went inside. It was damp inside but a light
shown through a hole in the ceiling. He looked around and the only thing he saw was a
small stone slab in the center of the cave. &quot;Yes, thats the answer Kurgen,&quot; said
the old man from behind him,&quot; You feel the gladius is wrong for you then place it
into the stone deep.&quot; &quot;I feel the urge too, but don't I need them for my
work,&quot; asked Kurgen. &quot;Not anymore, you can serve as a Bringer of Peace without
them. The magic you need is inside you,&quot; said the old man motioning to the
slab.&quot; I understand, but what will become of them?&quot; asked Kurgen. &quot;Your
heir will one day come here and claim the gladius as his own,&quot; said the old man
slowly. &quot;I understand,&quot; said Kurgen pulling out the gladius,&quot;I have become
to old for fighting anyways.&quot; Kurgen then brought the gladius over the slab right in
the center. &quot;Now Kurgen now,&quot; said the old man insistantly. The gladius began to
radiate green as Kurgen raised it into the air and brought it dow hard. The gladius sank
down to the hilt, it appeared as if the handle was only there. &quot;Now Kurgen, let us go
and settle your fate,&quot; said the old man patting Kurgen's shoulder. They then began to
change into sands as the breeze blew them away. In the room only a green handle glittered
a testimony to Dycrus and his warrior Kurgen. (*end*) </font></p>
