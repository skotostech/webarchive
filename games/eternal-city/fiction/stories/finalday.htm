  A Thief's Final Day
</H1>
<P align="left">
<SMALL>written by</SMALL> <SMALL>Amarad</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"I got some promises ta keep, n' miles ta go 'fore I sleep", Amarad
read the final words on the parchment he had taken from the body. He sighed,
knowing full well what he had done, but in the larger picture this was but
a grain of sand on an endless beach. "Why'd ya 'ave ta go n' get killed then
eh?", he sneered as he give the corpse of the thief a swift kick that sent
it flying several feet into a wall. Again he felt the pain and anger inside,
the desperate rage at how "unfair" life is, but this time he felt pity. A
clawing, groping feeling that made him uneasy....</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>He roared, "Dammit! It's not 'sposed ta be dis way!"</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>He pondered on what had happened. The townie had been satiating his
greed, and this was his punishment, he told himself. He heard the cry for
help in his mind, a desperate cry from another town rat. "This man has taken
my money! How will I ever feed my children!"</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>That didn't bother him, he knew life was rough, he hated how those
who don't deserve it are always the victim, but he lived in quiet acceptance
of this horrid truth. Finally, he could see the alledged thief several strides
away from where he was resting. "What tha 'ell, I'll take care a dis fer
ya..."</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Many thanks!"</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>He stepped into the fool's path, blocking his route out of the city.
The thief was quick, he had almost maneuvered the whole way around him before
he could even grab his gladius. "Fancy moves ya got thar townie, but yer
nothin.", he snickered. The thief was obviously enraged by what he had said.
"How dare you block my way, you don't know anything!". "I know yer a fool
n' a town rat, n' yer gonna get it in tha end either way." He took a deep
stride inward towards the thief, bringing his gladius in a wide upward arch
designed to cleave a man in two. He had slipped out of the way before it
could connect. He drew a small blade, a dagger with a serrated edge, wet
with blood. Amarad snickered, he loved it when they had a little kick in
them. The man lunged for his throat, Amarad threw him aside with a motion
of his gladius. The thief felt the cool run of Alanti run along his fingers,
slicing them deeply and forcing the weapon from his hand. He barely managed
the scream that followed. Amarad took a broad step to the side and let loose
a wild slash at the stunned man. The townie winced as his elbow was smashed
by the impact. "Well, thar we 'ave it. Mr. 'igh n' Greedy goes down like
tha rest." </SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"You don't understand! They never do! I stole it... but....."</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>He took the opportunity, taking a handfull of dirt from the street
with his un-mangled hand, he threw it into the barbarian's face. He ducked
back away from the snarling figure and began to run. Almost.... almost free...
The shock hit him like the plague. The cool metal dug deep into his waist.
He could feel his legs no more and dropped face down to the ground. "Damn
you....", he gasped. Amarad stood over him, blotting out the sun and staring
down upon him. "This is 'bout far as ya go thar." For the first time today,
Amarad felt the cold metal and seering pain enter his body. The thief had
jabbed his knife deep into the brute's ankle. He snarled, and in a rage,
plunged his gladius through the townie's neck as he dropped to his
knees.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Removing the dagger, he relinquished a plea for help to the people
of Midlight, along with the news of the thief's fate. "Thank you for getting
my money back sir!" He could only snarl at what he had done. He searched
the body, finding the said stolen goods, along with various other objects
and equiptment, most likely stolen as well. One thing in particular caught
his eye.... A small piece of parchment wrapped in well oiled leather in his
neckpouch. He took it from it's place and began to read:</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Dear Mielony,</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>The money that is accompanying this note should be enough to sustain
you in your current condition untill I can fully provide for you. Do not
worry where the money came from, it is yours now, a little gift from me.
I will not abandon you in your time of need, and you will never be "a burden"
to me. I have gained much skill in the art of fighting and perhapts I will
be able to better protect you in the future, so this will not happen again.
</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>This is hard to say, so I will write it... I love you.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>Good luck, may you recover from your injuries quickly."</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Truly love,"</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Garnet"</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"'e was goin' ta give it ta 'is girl...." the words hit him like the
shock of thunder on the plains. "What have I done?"</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Get yer money, I'm tired a' this." He sent out one last thought before
he sulked off to think. </SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>He cried out into the open sky, "~ROAR!~"</SMALL>
