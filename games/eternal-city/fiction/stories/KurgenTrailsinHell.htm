<h2 align="center">Kurgen: Trails in Hell</h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Long47</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Ravan's human face laughed at Kurgen. Kurgen stood their gladius pointed
out as if Ravan could be kept away by the simple blade. &quot;You are a fool Kurgen, put
the gladius down so that you might suffer your torture with alittle dignity,&quot; said
Ravan laughing. &quot;I got a better idea,&quot; said Kurgen jumping backwards and landing
outside the door. As soon as his two feet touched down he broke into a run, down the road
towards the house of the girl he had meet earlier. &quot;Its not like you can out run
me,&quot; said Raven with a chuckle, appearing right in Kurgen's path. Using his moment
Kurgen jumped over him and broke into a roll. Within reach of the house now, ten feet, 5
feet, DEAD END. Kurgen barely stopped as five carrion birds appeared in his path. Kurgen
sliced at the birds neck but his gladius didn't even leave a mark. &quot;No time for
this,&quot; said Kurgen throwing his shoulder into the door and falling inside. Kurgen
managed to get the door shut and locked. &quot;What is going on?&quot; asked the girl
appearing from a nearby room.&quot;Your one of Ravan's servant, get away!&quot; yelled
Kurgen at the confussed girl. &quot;No! Ravan took over my world, our world, he said he
had to use it to kill someone then he would leave. He promised power to our elders and the
accepted without thinking. That is how he is here, I do not serve him,&quot; said the girl
near tears. &quot;Why should I believe you?&quot; demanded Kurgen. &quot;Because of
this,&quot; she said rolling up her sleeve and showing him a glowing green tattoo, the
secret mark of Dycrus. &quot;So you found out my secret did you?&quot; questioned Ravan
once again appearing in human form,&quot;It will not help you!&quot; Ravan brought down
one of the arms which magically became a very sharp blade, Kurgen barely got his gladius
up in time to block. Kurgen then brought his sword down and slashed across Ravan's belly
leaving no mark. &quot;You can't defeat me you fool, How can you kill a god!&quot; laughed
Ravan in that demonic voice of his. For the first time in his life Kurgen was scared.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*****</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The old man,Kurgen's only friend, sat down on the cold rocks. He had
used white chalk to draw a circle around him,facing north was a large green candle that
was the only light in the cavern.&quot;Dycrus, grant me power, our hero Kurgen is trapped
in the world of past time. Grant me strength so I might grant him one message, allow me to
reach him and inform him of your power. Allow me to tell him that your will may have
powered the blade, it is the wielder's soul that grants it its power.&quot; said the man
in revernt prayer.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*****</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Kurgen had already given up hope of winning, how can a god be defeated
by a mere mortal? Kurgen hadn't given up though, he still parryed every blow and return
with a few pointless ones of his own. Ravan of course was just playing with his prey, he
had won, Kurgen didn't realize true power when he had it.&quot;Why do you presist?&quot;
asked Ravan,&quot; I gave that to a few cinerans lowly to me don't you like it?&quot;
&quot;I will not sacrefice my soul after so much work repairing it,&quot; said Kurgen
definately. &quot;Your soul has and always will belong to me, you gave it to me when you
became Warlord Kurgen, Destroyer of Dreams,&quot; said Ravan matter-of-factly. &quot;I am
no longer a Destroyer of Dreams, I am a bringer of peace for Dycrus and the old
ways,&quot; said Kurgen struggling for air. &quot;You tire 'Bringer of Peace',&quot; said
Ravan laughing like crazy,&quot; you are a fool, your heart has and always will be coal
black!&quot; &quot;Never,&quot; said Kurgen slowly but surely fighting. &quot;Give it up
fool, you aren't going to win!&quot; yelled Ravan as he came down hard on Kurgen's gladius
causing him to lose grip,&quot; There you go, you lose, do I kill you or torture
you?&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*****</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Kurgen, Hear me now, Your soul is the power to the blade and
cloak, use your soul to start them and the power will return. With the power you will be
able to fight Ravan!&quot; yelled the man in his head.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*****</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Kurgen heard the yelling in his head, and it gave him a headache.
&quot;Die Kurgen!&quot; screamed Ravan dropping his blade arms. A bead of blood appeared
on Kurgen's brow as he concentrated on the blade. As it slowly raised to meet Ravan's arm
the shimmering green returned to it.&quot;What? Not possible,&quot; said Ravn out of
suprise, he turned his arm and launched it across Kurgen stomach only to find his
shimmering green cloak had rotated into a mail cuirass and a lorica hamat to absorb the
blow. Kurgen just smiled as the green gladius flared,&quot; What weapon do you want to die
by?&quot; asked Kurgen joyfully. &quot;I have no intention of daying here,&quot; said
Ravan waving a hand and disappearing. &quot;I won!&quot; yelled Kurgen leaning on his
blade, but something inside didn't feel right.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*****</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Kurgen saved his laugh by using his soul to return the blade and cloak
with power. But in doing so Kurgen had drain a part of his soul away, the emptyness he
felt was his soul. A sword so powerful was used at such a high price. Kurgen set out from
the city now, searching for a way home and maybe a chance to return his soul to its full
power it once was.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(*to be concluded*)</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(*preview*) Kurgen begins to search the past looking for something to
fill the emptyness inside. Battling minions of Ravan to fighting bandits and brigands,
Kurgen must make a decision. Will he pay the cost to use the blade and cloak? Can a man
without his soul complete bring peace to a land? Find out in Kurgen's Soul.</font></p>
