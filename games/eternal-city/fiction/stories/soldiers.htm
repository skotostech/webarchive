<p><font size=-1>My father told me a story once but I can't remember who
they were fighting against.... nevertheless...it was about the friendship
between two soldiers, and the courage that one of them had.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The soldiers names were Murgus and Daillmanius...they
had trained together in the same Legion since they had both been recruited
to that Legion...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus was 8 years younger than Daillmanius. Daillmanius
was 24, and had been in other Legions before the one he was in at the time...but
Murgus had never been in any, so Murgus learned a lot from Daillmanius
during their times together..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>They had gotten to be best of friends, and would go pull
pranks on some of the other soldiers while they were sleeping...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>It was when least expected that they were called out to
march...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus had been excited for this moment for awhile..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Once everyone gathered their baggage and handed it over
to those that'd march with it, they grabbed their own weapon, and armor,
and formed their blocks...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Daillmanius could tell how anxious Murgus was, but didn't
say anything to him in response to it</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>They marched towards enemy grounds....</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>It was cold, and getting near dark...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>They halted just before enemy grounds..as Sir Tromonius
had some words to say...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>It began raining, as they moved towards enemy grounds
again..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Soldiers looking forward, and glancing to the side...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>They approached a stone wall..in front of the wall were
soldiers sleeping against it..some getting up at the sounds of Murgus'
and Daillmanius' Legion marching towards them...a cloth hanging over the
stone wall caught on fire, and burned away..as a soldier from atop lit
it...trumpets blared from Murgus' Legion, and theirs...carrying out signals..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus wielded his gladius as he grinned at Daillmanius.
Daillmanius nodded to Murgus, and wielded his own gladius.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The marched forth into the enemy lines, attacking any
enemy near by...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus caught site of an enemy and lunged at him, and
chopped at him..the enemy had anger in his eyes...Murgus caught sliced
in the shoulder, and at sight of this, Daillmanius engaged the enemy, and
began attacking him...together they killed the enemy...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>They chased an enemy off enemy grounds and onto their
own grounds, and as they engaged it, and began attacking it...the enemy
begged them to not kill him, for he knew Sir Tromonius was going to die,
after the enemies lost. Daillmanius chopped the enemy causing a gaping
wound to his head, and said "I can't trust you" and killed him.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Daillmanius pulled Murgus away from the light that was
left...and told him if what that man said was true, they needed to go and
protect Sir Tromonius, by passing that message on..Murgus nodded, and they
moved back into the light, to see 5 enemies standing there...3 engaged
Daillmanius' and knocked him unconscious..Murgus got away before they could
engage him</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Daillmanius yelled out, "You must survive, you must protect
Sir Tromonius!!"</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus hurried to a group of soldiers awaiting enemies,
tripping into the mud..he stood up and said, "No matter if we win this
war or not, once Sir Tromonius goes to the other side of this wall he's
going to die. They're not going to quit"</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The Soldiers looked at him for a moment, and considered
what he had just said. One of them grabbed Murgus, and said "Let's go!"
and they ran back towards the end of the march to find Sir Tromonius..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>They looked back and forth, and turned around several
times looking for him....the rain had made it hard to see and the mud made
it hard to move fast..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus spotted Sir Tromonius, and ran towards him, with
the soldier at his side..Sir Tromonius had been impaled...Murgus dragged
Sir Tromonius towards their camp grounds, while the soldier kept an eye
out from behind...Murgus explained to Sir Tromonius what the enemy had
said to him..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Once they reached camp, Sir Tromonius told the other solder
to head back, and call the rest to retreat..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Once they reached the campsite Murgus took Sir Tromonius
to a healer inside a tent, and wipe his face off, and turned away....he
stared at nothing...he wanted to win the war...he wanted Daillmanius to
survive...he wanted to fight in a war...</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>"Murgus," Sir Tromonius spoke, "We may not have one the
war..this time..but you saved my life. That's something to be proud of."</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus turned and smiled at Sir Tromonius, "I'm glad I
could help you, Sir"</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Murgus lived on..fought a second battle against the enemies,
and they won, without Sir Tromonius getting killed, and they succeeded
in gaining control over the enemies. Murgus retired from the Legion, and
spent many years telling his story at taverns. He never realized what he
had done...but he had done it..and those who were there, knew it..</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>One day he told his story to a man, his brother and his
child. The man told Murgus, "..we know each other, my friend. I'm Daillmanius,
and I'm very proud in your honorable savings of Sir Tromonius." Murgus'
eyes grew wide, and his face grew happy, and they drank ale, and talked
of old times, and laughed the rest of the night. Murgus was no longer sad,
and knew he was indeed, an honorable man.</font>
