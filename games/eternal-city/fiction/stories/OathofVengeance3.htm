<h2 align="center">Oath of Vengeance,&nbsp; Part 3</h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Bblalock</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A travel-worn stranger enters an inn just outside of the Tuchean
capital. Searching the crowd, his eyes stop on a familiar face. Wading through the busy
common room, Sharcu embraces his second* sister as she rises. Kersun whispers in Altene
&#147;What news of your Oath-Quest?&#148; as she returns to her seat. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sharcu silently mouths, &#147;A name. Here.&#148; in Altene, as he drops
into a chair. As he pulls his chair in close to the table, Sharcu beckons for a mug of
ale. Sharcu&#146;s lips shape the words &#147;One of the men who slew my first-family was
in debt to a moneylender.&#148; Paying the serving girl, Sharcu takes his mug and washes
the dust from his mouth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Kersun nods, &#147;So you need to find this man, and discover what he
knows.&#148; As she leans forward to whisper to Sharcu, Kersun&#146;s gladius is visible
for an instant. It bears the image of a lioness looking across a valley from a rocky
outcrop. &#147;Did you discover what they learned from your father?&#148; whispers Kersun.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Slowly shaking his head, Sharcu forms the words &#147;No. The one I
found was a fool, he would have known nothing&#148; with his mouth. Sharcu emits a low
rumbling growl, thinking a single thought, <em>if something was revealed, it must be put
right to restore the full honor of the Twenty-four</em>. Sharcu mouths, &#147;We must take
this man, and his entire household, he will know much.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">As Sharcu drains his mug, Kersun rises. Kersun murmurs, &#147;Second
brother, we must present this to the commander. We also have oath-rights in this matter.&#148;
Sharcu nods, and follows Kersun out the door. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Honor of the Twenty-Four will be avenged. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">* Cultural note: The Altene culture has been influenced by the
relatively high death rate among its people to alter and strengthen the customs regarding
adoption. Although the word &#147;second&#148; is often used to indicate this bond, it is
often much stronger among Altenes than the bond between those who are siblings by birth.</font></p>
