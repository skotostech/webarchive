<h1>Gladsman's Code</h1>

After getting his life back to a somewhat normal... For what is so normal about hunting thugs and brutes during the night and
killing bandits by the day? Taliseman finds himself pushing himself harder and harder to become better, faster than ever before.
He would take down five or six thugs... three or four brutes, run to Venina's, run to the bank to deposit his money, and run
back to the alleys to fight again. His nights and day were starting to blur as they all seemed to be forwarding his own personal
goal of becoming a greater gladsman. Fiona and Melinia grin as soon as he steps through the door, for with all the fighting, he is
finding himself getting stronger, and with this strength comes the urge to push himself more. He trys not to get distracted from
his goal. One day while in the forest with Fist, joking around while keeping a cautious eye on his surrounding, Taliseman finds
himself watching something moving around him. Standing up and going to the southwest a bit he finds himself upfront with a
newbie barely out of his novice days. Taliseman says that the forest is not a place for the weak.... but the youth with the
glimmer of bandit chest and armor glore... wouldn't listen. After a while Taliseman takes a small nap after dispatching 4 or 5
bandits himself....
<br><br>
Waking to the thought of "Help! Is there anyone in the forest???" is very distrubing. Taliseman stands and yells around for the
person needing help. Surprise! Surprise! Its the newbie again... surrounded by 7 or so bandits... a good fight for Taliseman by
himself. Being tired and weighed down were not the thoughts crossing his mind. The only thought was to help dispatch these
bandits and get the hell out of the forest with his body intact. Carefully watching his attacks and constantly changing his stances,
Taliseman (for the newbie was basically helping kill the uncon) got rid of five or six bandits. With only one or two left...
Taliseman starts grinning. He will get out once the last 2 are uncon. Than wth the unlucky stroke of Ereal... the last two bandits
were joined by 4 of their comrades. Barely able to lift the sword, Taliseman tells the newbie to run. The newbie for some
reason.. sees this as an act on my part to gain what would be left IF Taliseman could kill the bandits. Taliseman being the
honorable man he is... decieded to stay and try to help. Than with one swift strike from a spear, Taliseman clutched his
stomach... watching his guts spill onto the ground. The bandit pulled the spear from Taliseman's limp body and turned to the last
standing opponent......
