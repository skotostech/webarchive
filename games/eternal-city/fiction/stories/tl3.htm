<SMALL>Hearing voices early in the morning in the hallway, is not an everyday
occurance. I take my backpack of goodies, take my black wool sack, and right
before putting my sagum on, grab my trusty hood and throw it around me. The
warmth of my hood is a comforting feeling, even for a man who steals and
tricks others as a way of life. After my ritual swig of wine, I decide that
living in this room, after yesterdays meager, but earnest attempt at my life,
I should find somewhere else to live. The Stone Toga is not even a thought
in my mind, for my way of life, does not suit living so close to where the
people are. Not to mention the fact that my tolerance for the ijits that
seem to flock to the Toga and the amount of policing by the Constables, hardly
makes it appealing as say... a room in Vetallun. The Wayfarer seems like
a good place to take up residency for now. Being a man who knows that I could
pay for a room... or I could steal for one, money is not an issue. I gather
my stuff quickly and open my room's door one last time than close the door,
but not locking it. I go downstairs and give my key to the innkeeper than
pull my hood over my head. Carrying 5 sacks on my back, and the added weight
of my personal chest, I walk slower than usual. I find this very dangerous,
but I must move. The men that had assualted me now knew that I lived somewhere
in Monlon. They would be waiting and than as I have seen in the past, more
will be waiting, and eventually they would have set traps to kill me. I cannot
allow this to happen. Not that life isn't fun, but I grow weary of the days,
the light, and the goodness of the citizens of Midlight. I allow these thoughts
to run through my head until I finally reach the Wayfarer. Searching the
area first, than going inside meet Rachina the bartender. I walk to where
the rooms are sold. Finding out the amount I am going to pay for this room
makes me laugh. I nod and pay the keeper and I am given the key. I follow
the keepers directions until I make it to the door with the same marking
as on the key. I put the unlock and enter my new room. After scattering my
possessions and various items around the room I lay down apon the bed. </SMALL>

<SMALL>Letting my mind wander I wonder if there was a way to squeeze the
good and perfect people of Iridine, so that the natural hate and discomfort
that is there can be released. Everyone says that Cinners are bad, and that
they are going to take over Iridine. I could care less. The Cinners, the
Iridians, the foreigners, what is the difference to me? They are all people
that live in Midlight for me to prey on. Life is only worth living if you
make some kind of profit. How you make this profit... that is a matter not
only of what you are good at, but also what you have a chance to do. I think
back to being a child and my parents worked as servants for a wealthy patrician.
They made very little moneys for the amount of effort they put into their
work. My father died first and he left me and my mother with nothing. I was
than put to work in the house with my mother. I found the work, not to my
liking, and I spent most of my time watching the work being done and being
beaten as a result. As time went on I remember my mother giving me part of
her supper so I could stay healthy. The day she fell down because she was
so weak she could not work, was the day I started to steal. I stole small
items at first. Such as food, or a coin or two. I find that this was much
more easier than actually working for the denar to pay for these things.
Than one day I was caught taking a carrot from the pot. My first and last
mistake. I left the house and I entered the city, where I first started to
prey on Iridine's citizens and wealthy patricians.....</SMALL>
