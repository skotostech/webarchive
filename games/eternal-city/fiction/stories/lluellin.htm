<h2 align="center">Lleullin's Dream</h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Lluellin <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I wandered through the mists for a while, in total darkness. Then there
was a dim light off in the distance, so I began walking toward it. There, standing in
front of me, was the man. He pushed back his hood to reveal hair that glinted like
moonlight, and glowing violet eyes. His eyes were sad, and they looked right through me as
I stood there. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Hello,&quot; I said to him. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Greetings, my lovely one,&quot; he whispered. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I looked up at him, and drew back a step or two, which provoked a frown
on his lovely face. His skin was pale, like he had spent far too many days out of the
sunlight, but still he was perfect. I thought to myself, &quot;He really is
beautiful.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">He looked sharply at me then, as if he could read my thoughts. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; I asked him. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I only want you to stay here, and be my friend,&quot; he murmured
in response. Then he stepped closer to me, reaching his hand out toward my face. When I
backed up again, he sighed softly and began to speak again. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I have many good things I can offer to you here, little one,&quot;
he smiled slowly at me, then, and my pulse began to race. With one wave of his hand, a
small table appeared, covered with delicious sweets. &quot;If you stay here with me, you
can have whatever you desire, whenever you wish it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I looked longingly toward the table, then shook my head slowly. &quot;I
can not eat your food here, something tells me it wouldn't be at all wise,&quot; I
responded. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Another smile played across his lips as he nodded to me. &quot;Very
well, then.. but you can not refuse this gift.&quot; With another wave, I was garbed in a
silken gown. It was violet, to match both of our eyes, and made of the sheerest, softest
silk. I looked down at myself and blushed furiously, for the silk was so sheer that it
revealed a hint of the skin beneath the gown. The man's eyes looked me over slowly, from
the top of my head to the tips of my bare feet. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Ah, you look even more delectable than my table of sweets,&quot;
he said, and stepped toward me again. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Once again I stepped away from him, and his eyes flickered with anguish.
A third wave of his hand, and I stood in a walled garden. All around me bloomed the rarest
and most delicate of flowers, the gentlest smelling herbs, and the greenest foliage I had
ever seen. The walls of the garden were only waist high, and there were two barred gates
set into the walls. The man stood outside one of the gates, looking at me with longing in
his eyes. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Let me into your garden, my precious one,&quot; he said, &quot;and
I will give you the sweetest gift of all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I looked into his eyes, and began to walk toward him. His face lit up
with a joyous smile as he saw that he had finally managed to break down my defenses. My
hands began to tremble as I timidly returned his smile. Just as I stretched my hand out to
the latch on the gate, though, I heard a soft voice calling my name. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Lleullin!&quot; the voice called, with a tone of despair. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The man's face darkened, and he gestured for me to continue toward him.
Instead, I took my hand back away from the latch and looked over my shoulder. Standing by
the other gate were two misty forms, one with his arms stretched out toward me. As I
focused my eyes on the forms, it became obvious who was standing there, calling to me. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Scio!&quot; I shouted anxiously. I began to walk toward him, and
after a few steps I could see the second form more clearly. It was Desaix, with Sage
cradled in his arms. Both men looked at me anxiously, not seeming to notice my clothing or
surroundings. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">After a few more steps toward them, the walls around the garden shot up,
now well above my head in height, and the gate disappeared. Somehow I could perceive them
through the wall still, for both men had started to scale the wall, and Sage sat on the
ground behind them. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You shall not leave here, my dearest one,&quot; the man whispered
softly, &quot;and you will let me in.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;No, I will leave here. I will find a way through,&quot; I replied,
and continued walking toward the wall. When I arrived beside the wall, I could see that
the men were almost to the top. My stomach dropped, for I greatly feared that it would be
dangerous to both of them to enter the garden. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Closing my eyes, I murmured to myself, &quot;It is a dream, only a
dream,&quot; and I stepped right through the wall. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The next thing I knew, I was awake again. </font></p>
