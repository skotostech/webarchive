<p><font size=-1>Chapter 2 Haunted Dreams</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>He slept for what seemed days, over and over he dreamed
of the actions that lead to his parents death, he saw him self standing
in the battle watching but not being able to help, he was nothing, he could
do nothing, and in the end the soldiers came for him, He tried to run but
the soldiers were too quick, he stumbled falling to the ground. rolling
onto his back he stared up into the face of the soldier who was not a soldier,
his face was twisted and blurred in the darkness underneath his helm. Two
glowing eyes stared down at him, into him viewing his very soul. In a harsh
voice the shadowed man Said to him, Ï your soul is scared, you belong to
meÓ. With a mighty downward thrust the figure brought down his pitch black
gladius at his chest. He sat straight up in the floor where he had fallen
asleep. His breath, quick and shallow, heart beating as it would pound
free from his chest, drenched in sweat. It had been nearly a week since
the news of his parents death came and since that day the vision of the
shadowy figure haunted him, in his dreams as well as in life, he had heard
the voice in the street but never saw from whom it came, sometimes he would
hear it when he was the only one around, like a whisper in his mind, like
a ghost or a bad memory, it haunted him. Slowly he calmed down and started
about his day, counting the money from his father, he found he had only
12 denars to his name. Ïuhhhg, how am I going to live off 12 Denars, barely
enough for a good mealÓ. Sighing heavily he looked near the door at the
chest the soldier had dropped off the week earlier. He didnÌt want to open
it, the memories it would unleash were too great for him to bear, But it
had to be done, how else would he live. Slowly he opened the chest, inside
his fathers armor, gladius and shield, also his mothers bow, and some jewelry
that she wore. Again tears ran down his cheeks as he remembered his parents.
The lid of the chest slammed shut and he was out the door running down
the street. For hours he walked and thought. what was he to do, where was
he to go, everything he loved was gone, he had nothing except memories
that hurt too much to think about. the day moved on and the sun set behind
the horizon casting a pale red glow across the western sky. He sat on the
cliffs staring out over the ocean wishing he was anywhere but Iridine,
But how would he escape the prison that bound him, he did not know. ÏArincar!!Ó
a voice came from behind him ÏWe have been searching High and Low for you,
what are you doing out here by the cliffs anyway?Ó. It was Chadorius his
closest friend. He sat on the edge of the cliff next to Arincar and stared
off over the ocean ahead of them, An ocean of dreams it seemed, what was
beyond the horizon intrigued him. turning to Arincar he said softly, ÏWhats
happened to you Arin, you use to be so content with your life, Now you
seem almost.... deadÓ ÏMaybe I should be dead Chad, I should have died
with them you know, Why do I have to live with this, Why must I be the
one to suffer this pain, Its not fair, what does it matter I am dying on
the inside, all I feel now Is hatred towards those who killed my Parents.Ó
Silence fell between them and Arincar looked out over the ocean once more,Ó
I am Leaving Iridine, I cant be here anymore.Ó Chadorius stared at Arincar
not knowing what to say, ÏWhat do you mean your leaving, how are you going
to get away, you have no money, you have never been outside the city walls
your entire life, you will be killed out there.Ó ÏThen so be it, If I die
who will care I have nothing left.ÓArincar stood up and Started down the
street. ÏArin wait upÓ Chad yelled out as he ran to catch up with him.
ÏI am coming with you, we will leave together, the two of us together can
do more than one of us alone.Ó ÏNow, how are we getting out of this cityÓ
Chad smiled and Arincar gave him a sideways glance, ÏI cant let you come
with me, you parents wouldnÌt let you anyway.Ó ÏMy parents, cant stop me
and I cant let you go alone, either I go with you or I will tell those
Priests down in the Hospice youÌve lost your mind and have you locked up
for them to study.Ó ÏYou always was a pain in my ass Chad, But if you want
to die with me out there then you are welcome to join me, but dont think
I am going to save your hide if you get into any trouble. I have my own
path to follow Ï. The Sky had turned pitch black as dark storm clouds slowly
floated by like an omen of death. Within the small house, Arincar stared
a the chest of armor and clothes the Legion had left. After a time he pulled
out his fathers armor, It was a little big on him but he still had time
to grow into it, the weight was almost too much for him to bear but he
figured it would protect him in an attack. He felt awkward wearing it,
thinking his Father had met his end in this armor. He pushed those thoughts
out of his mind and pulled out his fathers Shield and Gladius, feeling
the weight carefully in his hands. It wasnÌt bad enough the armor weighed
so damn much but the gladius and shield together he could not handle, so
he decided to rid himself of the Gladius to afford him a bit more protection
with the shield. ÏIn the MorningÓ he said to himself as he removed the
Armor and settled down for sleep. Sleep came quickly and he was in an open
field. Above him the Stars were bright and Raven was in the middle of the
sky casting its gray shadows on the land. He looked around but all was
silent... except for his own mind which tried to rationalize why he was
there. Then from the ground came a low rumble and Fire shot up towards
the heavens from large cracks in the ground. The heat was intense and he
shielded his eyes with his arms. When he looked up again a wavering figure
was walking towards him from the flames. Quickly he looked around him looking
for something to defend himself with, Then he realized he was wearing his
fathers armor and his shield lay on the ground beside him. He gazed at
the figure coming towards him and lifted the shield in front of him anticipating
an attack. ÏWho are youÓ He called out, But there was no answer. ÏTell
me, Who are youÓ. The figure stopped 10 feet from him and looked him square
in the eyes. ÏI am your Destiny Arincar, I am he that decides your path
in life I am your master, your death, your Savior.Ó Arincar looked confused
ÏI am not a slave and I will live my life how I see fit. You claim to be
my Savior but all you do is haunt my dreams, You are nothing but my imagination
running wild with the fear of Death, You can not kill me, this is my dream,
My world now get out of my head and leave me in peace.Ó ÏI cant do that,
you see, this is my World, you came here on your own free will, you summoned
me to save you and bring you into that which is Eternal... the Power that
which rules over Death.. I am Raven and you belong to me.Ó ÏI will not
listen to you, Demon, Now begone before I have to remove you by force,
I fear not you, even if you are Raven, I fear nothing not even death. If
I came here and summoned you then why do I resist you, If I wanted you
to bring me into your power wouldnÌt you think I would come willingly.Ó
ÏEnoughÓ The figure shouted out ÏI tire of your games its time for you
to dieÓ With a powerful lunge the Warrior charged him with gladius held
in front of him. With a slight rotation of the Shield Arincar Deflected
the sword from him and slammed it down in and powerful swing bashing the
figure with the edge of his shield at the base of his neck. An audible
Snap was heard as the figure slumped lifelessly to the ground. ÏYou call
yourself a god yet you cannot defeat even the weakest opponent.Ó Turning
Arincar raised an arm and waved in a wide arc through the Air and the flames
were gone and only the night remained. he felt he could do anything here,
in his dreams, then, from the corner of his eye he caught movement and
spun around. The Figure stood in front of him gladius raised above his
head. Arincar jumped back in surprise and the Gladius came down catching
his armor and imbedded itself in his shoulder. With a cry of pain Arincar
slumped to his knees. Ïyou will pay for this Demon, Mark my words. With
an upward swing the shield smashed into the side of the warriors helm knocking
him off his feet. With a quick glance he noticed there was blood on the
edge of his Shield, ÏBloodÓ he said questioningly, ÏIf you be a God then
why do you bleed, You go back to Raven and tell him if he wants my soul
he will have to come and get it himself.Ó With all his strength he brought
the shield down in a powerful arc against the warriors head. A metallic
clank was heard as the helm buckled from the force of the blow and crushed
it wearers skull. With a feeling of hope Arincar turned around looking
for a way out of where ever he was, sleep, Dreamland, Ravens realm he didnÌt
know but he didnÌt like it. A flash of Lightning streaked across the sky
illuminating the surroundings. Off in the distance stood a low hill and
what he thought might be a small cave. He headed there in hopes of escaping
the coming rain. After a few hundred feet another bolt of lighting struck
the ground about a quartermile away from him, Then another an another,
each marking a path straight toward him. He took off in a full sprint for
the cave with the lightning growing ever closer. Only a couple hundred
yards to go, he thought as he ran through the tall grasses. Then there
was silence, He slowed his pace and looked over his shoulder...nothing,
it just stopped he thought, he was 50 feet from the cave now and a bolt
of white lightning struck not ten feet behind him, startled he jumped for
the cave entrance and as he hit the cold rock inside a last bolt hit the
cave opening shaking the ground around him, He scrambled deeper in as the
entrance collapsed in a small rock slide. Silence and darkness surrounded
him, Only his breath could be heard in his prison of earth and rock, then
suddenly, A flame appeared in front of him as if someone had lit a torch.
In fact someone had, Looking across the small cavern at him was an old
man with long gray hair, A quarterstave by his side, and wearing a combination
of leather and bronze armor. His eyes lit up as he looked at Arincar and
he began to laugh. ÏWhats in you old man, Laughing at me like that.Ó the
laughter subsided and the old man said to him, ÏExcuse my rudeness, I would
introduce myself but I think you already know who I am.Ó With a big grin
he pulled a flask out of his back pack and drank the contents. Smiling
he offered the flask to Arincar and he accepted, Although a little uneasy
and took a sniff of the flask ÏCinnamon TeaÓ he exclaimed, ÏI havenÌt had
any of this since before...Ó Silence fell across his face and the old man
finished Ïsince your parents Died.Ó With a rage in his eyes he turned to
the old man ÏHow would you know about that, I dont even know who you are
and I doubt you ever knew my parentsÓ ÏAyeÓ he replied. Ï I knew your parents
well.. you see I know a little secret that you dont and if your nice enough
I will share that with you, But once I tell you, you will most likely call
me crazy.Ó Ïwell Honestly, I already thought you were crazy going off with
all that laughter and allÓ Arincar took a long draw from the flask and
handed it back to the old man. ÏSo tell me old man, What be your secret.Ó
With a quick glance at the interior of the cavern he looked straight into
Arincars Eyes. ÏYou see lad, the reason I know who you are and what happened
to your parents is... well its because I AM YOU.Ó Arincar sat with a dumbfounded
look on his face then with a sound of disbelief said, ÏYou really are a
loony arent you, sayin your me and all, Look at you , you must be 50 years
old with all that gray hair, Aint no way you could be me.Ó ÏAsk me a question
I will answer it, you will understand what I mean.Ó ÏOKÓ Arincar though
for a moment ÏWhats my best friends name?Ó The old man chuckled ÏChadorius..
thats little easy dont you think?Ó ÏA wise guy huh, well lets see if you
know this... Whats my Uncles occupationÓ HeÌs a Pirate but wont admit it
to anyone, says he is an importer and exporter of fine goods, most of which
he gets for free if you know what I meanÓ said the old man with a wink.
ÏWow you must be a good friend of my uncle to know that..Ó ÏIÌll tell you
what young lad, IÌll prove to you that I am you, look at you left arm,
you have a scare from where your father cut you during a sparing session,
He hit you a little too hard and didnÌt forgive himself for weeks after
it happened, Now look at my left arm, Same place, same scar... now do you
believe me?Ó Arincar looked in disbelief at the matching scar on the old
mans arm ÏAnd for your information IÌm not 50 years old , I am 36 and you
will have all this fabulous gray hair by the time your 27, too many years
out to sea will do that too ya, specially when your fighting to survive
on one of your uncles ships, Dont ask me why I am here its as much your
dream as it is mine, just a little peculiar how here I am and I am talking
to you a vision from my past..Ó ÏPast?Ó Arincar said questioningly Ïyou
must be mistaken I must be dreaming about my future.Ì ÏWell either way,
we are both here, and we are both stuck in a cave and I must depart for
I am about to wake, But maybe in the future our paths will meet again.Ó
ÏBut waitÓ Arincar spoke out ÏHow do I get out of here?Ó ÏUse your Imagination,
It always worked for me, and, Before I go, Those dreams your having, About
Raven and all that.... well on second thought IÌll let you figure it out
your self.Ó With a smile he vanished into thin air. Arincar sat in the
dark cavern thinking about what had just happened then realized he still
needed to find a way out. Feeling around the floor his hands ran across
what felt like a torch, for a brief second he was ecstatic the he remembered
he had nothing to light it with. He sat down on the cold rock and just
hoped he would wake up. Minutes and hours went by and nothing happened
then he remembered what the old man had told him, use my imagination. He
imagined his torch was lit and instantly flames lit up the room. He looked
around there was no where to go so he imagined he had a door that led into
his house and a door appeared in the wall, He grinned and pulled open the
door and he was looking into his room and he was asleep in his bed, but
there was someone else in the room as well. He jumped through the door
at the person and found himself laying in his bed, and he realized he just
woke up, Turning around he saw a figure above him, He couldnÌt make out
the face as it was still dark outside and the figure jumped letting out
a surprised scream. Leaping out of bed he wrestled the person to the floor
pinning their arms to the ground with his knees. Reaching over to his dresser
he got a candle and lit it with a small tinderbox. What he saw sent a surprised
look across his face. It was a woman....</font>
