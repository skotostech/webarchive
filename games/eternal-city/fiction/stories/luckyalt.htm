<SMALL>Darkness had covered the land in its blanket, as only the few warriors
in the village moved about. They were Altenians and this was their homeland,
but they now were faced by an invasion by a suprisingly large and fercious
army. The King had ordered every village to prepare for an all out retreat
from the country to a distant land of peace where they could rebuild.
Unfortunately some of the smaller towns already under siege had little choice
but to hope for a window of oppertunity to present itself. This is the story
of a boy only 14 years old who would save his people.</SMALL>

<SMALL>The men sat in their makeshift trenches facing the enemy lines. They
were grimmed-face and dirty, not a one a coward, but they were not fighters.
These were simple farmers who had taken up their farming tools in defense
of their home. The had no mind to left the siege and many were died or wising
they were.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"What is that soldier saying," questioned one of the men in the
trench.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"I don't know I can't hear him," replied his childhood friend sitting
in cold, muddy water.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"I think they are asking us to surrender," commented the man walking
past, the oldest one of them.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Well, could surrend be worse then this?" questioned the first
man.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"You idiot, if we surrender they will kill us, rape our women, and
enslave our children," scowled the man sitting in water.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"You did hear what they did to Fru, the village up the road?" asked
the man who had assumed leadership," The killed every male within miles and
enslaved all the women. The houses were burned to the ground and their Holy
Temple disecrated."</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Wait just a minute..."warned the second man.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"What is it?" demanded the first.</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"Is it just me or did their front line just move forward," asked the
second man</SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>"MEN TO YOUR DEFENSES!!!" yelled the commander as the first enemy
soldier reached the trenches. Soon it was just a mess of bodies battling
one another. Everything from weapons, fist, to teeth were being used. And
the muddy waters of the trenches ran red with the blood of both sides, but
in the end numbers prevailed. The enemy began to gradually rape, pillage,
and plunder their way through the small village. Burning every empty house
they came across. </SMALL>
<P ALIGN=left>
<SMALL>A boy barely having seen 14 winters watched from his hiding place
the beating and the pain the enemy put his mother and sisters through, leaving
their battered corpses on the ground as soon as their sick games were finished.
He stayed in his hole and watched as the only home he had know was set to
flames, and as the walls began to give way the roof collapsed. Falling on
the boy and covering him in the rubble. Though injuried in the fall, the
roof covered his limp, unconsious form as the enemy searched the village
one last time. They miraclous didn't notice the boy, left among the ruins
of his life....</SMALL>
