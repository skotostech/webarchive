<h2 align="center">Kivlan</h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Lantar<br>

</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped, pausing to catch his breath, leaning
on the wooden spear. Raising his head once again, he looked around him. Vultures had
already begun to circle the air, and the thick scent of death was strong in his nostrils.
Knowing the urgency of his mission, he set back into a steady run, the wooden spear tucked
under his arm. Once again, he stopped to catch his breath, and gazed at the sight around
him. From the hill upon which he stood he could see much more than before. Crimson red
streaked the grass on the far away hills, giving it a dull sheen. More carrion birds had
appeared, a dark cloud in the sky. Running his hand along the spear, and then along the
gaping wound in his side, he took a deep breath. &quot;Not... too... late...&quot; he
muttered, his eyes falling to rest on a small stone villa. &quot;Not... too...
late...&quot; he repeated. Breaking into a run, he raced toward the villa. Suddenly, he
stopped. Falling to his knees, he began to sob. Hours passed, yet he knelt there, sobbing,
until the tears came no more. &quot;Never... again...&quot; he mouthed, the words dieing
on his lips. He raised his head, staring at the spear. Not his spear, but the one
protruding from the pale chest of his only love. Once again, hours passed, as he stared at
the impaled corpse. Then, raising his head, and looking into the sky, he changed. His face
turned to stone, his heart to ice. Pulling the spear from the chest of his once beloved,
he hefted the spear in his hand. He eyed it critically, and dropped his own, the wooden
hunting spear. Placing the bronze tipped spear under his arm, he turned his back to the
villa, and walked, not knowing where his feet would take him. Only once he began to look
back, and only once did he stop himself, and he said quietly, &quot;Never again.&quot;</i>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kivlan awoke with a start. Sweat trickled down his
cheek. Or was it a tear? Brushing it away, he stood up from bed, and walked to the mirror.
Gazing at himself, he silently noted the change that had overcome. Where he was once was
muscular, he was now guant and thin. That had not effected his strength though. The health
looked drained from his face, and his skin had an ashen grey color. His cheeks, nose, and
lips were all much thinner too. <i>Such is the price to pay</i>, he said to himself. <i>I
am now much stronger than I have ever been</i>. Dressing, he eyed the bronze tipped spear
propped against his bed. Once finished dressing, he grabbed it and shoved it through a
loop in his belt. He walked outside, into the bright sunlight. Squinting at the sun, he
realized it was later than he believed. He began to walk down the wide cobble stone road,
gazing at his surroundings. Iridine was as large and more magnificant than the stories
said. Yet, that did not concern him. Nothing did. Only death. He killed, cooly, and
calmly, without the slightest hint of emotion. Just as he lived. Fingering the spear
latched to his belt, he continued on. He passed by an inn, the Stone Toga, and into the
harbor area. Not caring where his feet took him he continued. Noticing a large crowd
gathered around a fountain in the harbor, he stopped. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What's happening here?&quot; Kivlan asked in a
near whisper voice. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We are chasing someone.&quot; A small slender
man replied. Kivlan nodded, and stood back quietly, listening to the scene. As a young
woman described the whereabouts of the person the crowd was chasing, Kivlan stood there,
not moving, or even blinking. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Are you? I will assist then.&quot; Kivlan said,
mainting the emotionless voice. Suddenly, a small woman spoke up. She smelled of roses, as
if she had rolled in them. The smell was overpowering, enough to make a person seek a more
open space. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why are you so emotionless?&quot; She said in a
high pitched, whining voice. Kivlan slowly shifted her gaze toward her. He raised an
eyebrow, then let it drop. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am what I am. Do you envy me?&quot; The woman
frowned, and whispered to her small, slender companion. The young woman continued the
description of the crowds prey. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What is this man?&quot; Kivlan whispered. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's Maran.&quot; A tall, muscular man, wearing
the medallion of a constable answered. &quot;Maran, slaughterer of children, heretic, and
commiter of treason.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I see. And you are hunting him?&quot; Kivlan
said in his monotone, near silent voice. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes!&quot; Squealed the short, woman who reeked
of roses. &quot;We will hunt him and kill him.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He has done nothing to you personally. Why
should we help this woman? What is our reward?&quot; Kivlan questioned quietly. Again, the
rosey woman frowned and whispered to her companion. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have you no soul?&quot; She whispered. For the
first time in years, Kivlan smiled. However, it was not a smile of joy, but of pain... A
grim smile, conveying only hatred. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; He said quielty. &quot;Perhaps I'll
steal yours.&quot; With this, the rose woman burst into a tantrum of anger, and whispered
madly to her companion. Kivlan chuckled inwardly, enjoying the hate shooting from the rose
womans eyes. <i>Perhaps Iridine may be useful to me after all... </i>Kivlan once again
eyed the scene, not showing the slightest hint of emotion. The rose woman and her
companion were exchanging angry words back and forth until suddenly the companion
screamed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By Ereal! He's attacking Shade!&quot; Kivlan
raised an eyebrow to the obvious madmn, still showing not a sliver of emotion. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Am I? I apologize, I did not notice.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Narius, shut yer ijit trap before I slam my
stave down your throat.&quot; The tall, muscular constable said. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pompeii, stay out of this.&quot; Narius said
while glaring angrily at Kivlan. Kivlan shifted his gaze from Narius to Shade, eyeing both
with the usual lack of emotion. He then turned to face the young woman, giving the mission
to hunt down this &quot;Maran&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I will help you.&quot; Kivlan whispered.
&quot;Perhaps this will fill the void.&quot; Suddenly, the void shook. Memories flashed. <i>Spears...Blood...Blood
everywhere! Death...death...WHY!? Maritia...</i> Then it was still. The memories faded.
Kivlan shifted his gaze to Pompeii. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Lead on.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*** </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Kivlan... Kivlan... I have heard the cry of your soul... You would
give yourself to me... You are mine! MINE!!!!</i> </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Panting, Kivlan awoke. Sitting up, he
searched widly around the room with his usual calm, blank eyes, but found nothing. Leaning
forward, he caught his breath. <i>I am going mad.</i> Smiling grimly, he recalled the
events of his past month in Iridine. The failed hunt for Maran. Joining of the constables.
Joining of the legions... Investigating a murder... Suddenly his breath caught. The
murder... Kivlan laid down, remembering with crystal clarity... </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*** </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember... events... that day... the murder...</i>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This will be your first real job,
recruits!&quot; Pompeii said eagerly. &quot;We will be investigating the murder of a
priest in the forum, near the temple of Ereal.&quot; <i>Murder... blood... death...
spears... No... a symbol...where is the symbol...</i> </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&quot;By Ereal!&quot; One of the recruits said, gazing at
the dead priests sprawled on the cobblestones. Blood had smeared the area, covering the
nearby walls... <i>Blood...the blood... The wall... that wall... a symbol... moons...
death... the pain... the blood... The answer! The symbol!</i> </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*** </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening his eyes, Kivlan once again sat up, blinking
from the memories which flashed through his minds eye. He knew the voice now. He did not
know why he had been chosen, but he knew the voice. Kivlan smiled grimly, a smile of pain,
a smile lacking emotion. &quot;We will see,&quot; he whispered. &quot;We will see.&quot;
Standing and dressing, he made his way to the Stone Toga Inn. An interesting day was
before him, and an even more interesting night... </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kivlan eyed the scene, and the traveller that had
entered the room. The traveller was quite pale, the flesh hanging from his bones, and
quite thin. As if a sickness had overcome him. Much like Kivlan, yet...not. Gazing at the
sky, Kivlan listened to the story of the traveller. Time passed quickly, and night soon
set in. Suddenly, the clatter of hooves were heard outside the inn, and a gush of wind
slammed the door shut. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ereal! What was that?&quot; A young man asked
warily. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Wind. A mounted soldier.&quot; Kivlan responded
in his normal, quiet monotone. People were no used to his lack of emotion. He had been
accepted here, as strange as people thought he was. Pompeii nodded in agreement. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't know...&quot; Another young man said.
&quot;It seemed... not right.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I see.&quot; Kivlan whispered. Just as he said
that, the door slammed open, and the neigh of a horse was heard. However, this time, the
sound was above the inn. Rain pounded the inn, and the night darkened even more. The crowd
burst into madness, murmering of the unnatural darkness... Of the powers that could be
felt in the air... </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Damnation, I'm going to investigate.&quot;
Pompeii muttered. &quot;Who's coming with me?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I will.&quot; Kivlan whispered. Some others
stepped forward, and all followed Pompeii. Stepping outside, into the fury of the storm, a
voice cracked through the minds of the party like a whip, dropping people to their knees,
infurating others. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>COME TO ME POMPEII... I KNOW YOU SEEK ME... I AM
AT A GREAT PLACE OF POWER ON THIS GREAT NIGHT... COME POMPEII! COME!</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pompeii stood, and screamed, shaking his fist at the
heavans. &quot;I know you're their Payne! And you're dead! You don't exist! Get out of my
damned head!&quot; Pompeii let out a final growl, and gestured to the party. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Follow me, I know where to find them.&quot; He
growled, readying his quarterstave. Him and the party set off running down the wet
streets, toward the harbor part of town. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Kivlan stood nearby, in the pouring rain,
unaffected by the voice or rain. However, the urge... the call... did not fade away.
Something tugged at him, something strong. He set off in the direction of Pompeii and the
party. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This is the place.&quot; Pompeii said,
gesturing to a fallen down grain silo. Kivlan suddenly appeared, stepping out of the
darkness, dripping wet. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Decided to join us, eh, Kivlan?&quot; One of
the party members said. Kivlan only nodded, and ducked into the silo behind Pompeii. As he
stepped inside though, he reeled back, inhaling deeply. That smell... Memories flashed... <i>Blood...death...Maritia...the
priest...symbol...</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There has been a killing here.&quot; Kivlan
whispered. As the party set out to find the victom, a black shape charged from the
darkness of the silo, rearing up, striking at the party with hooves shod with pure
darkness. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I've seen these things before! Stand
back!&quot; Pompeii yelled, spinning his quarterstave until it was only a blur. Suddenly,
the horse fell, it's neck broken in half. As it fell, it disintegrated into the darkness
from which it came. Panting, Pompeii leaned on his stave. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Payne is definatly here, that was one of
his...pets. Let's continue.&quot; The party once again set out down the dark silo. As they
neared the end the smell thickened until it was nearly impossible to breathe. Suddenly,
light flickered, and&nbsp; four candles burt into flame, each placed around a gutted body.
Along the body intricate symbols were carved, not a drop of blood where it was not
intended. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ereal...&quot; The entire party gasped. Except
Kivlan. Gazing at the body, wind tickled his ear. <i>Wind, in a building? </i>Kivlan gazed
around, but saw nothing. As he returned his gaze to the body, he felt a hand on his
shoulder, and the wind in his ear once again. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Kivlan...</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kivlan...</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kivlan... I know what you want... I will give it to you... Is
this what you want?</i> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Suddenly Kivlan fell to his knees, shaking.
His eyes welled up, pain flooded through his body. Tears flowed down his cheeks, and
emotion flooded into his mind. The memories flashed, stronger than ever. But emotion came
with them... The emotion he had blocked off for so many years. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;EREAL!&quot; Kivlan screamed, ripping apart his soft voice.
&quot;WHAT IS IT!?&quot; Suddenly, he stood, and began panting. An odd light shone in his
eyes, and he gazed around madly. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The pain! So bright... is it light? The dark... of night so dark
the light pain! Brightness, darkness... Death! Blood... Madness... It comes... He comes...
Death! What is death? Death is him! He is death! The Pain! Blood! DARKNESS! Emotion... I
HAVE EMOTION!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heads whipped around. Jaws dropped. Weapons drew. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Kivlan!?! What is wrong with you?! What has
gotten into you?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He's insane! I say we kill him!&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, he's possessed! By Payne&quot; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then abruptly, it stopped. The insane babble of Kivlan broke off with
&quot;Death!&quot;, and he dropped to his knees, sobbing. The wind brushed by his ear
again, this time uttering only two words... </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Prove yourself...</i> </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Kivlan fainted into a heap,
blood streaming from his hand where he clenched the blade of his spear in a death grip. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">*** </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kivlan awoke, the light streaming into his eyes. He
looked around, and laughed. The dreams did not plague him that night. He laughed again,
and sat up. Gazing at himself in the mirror, he threw his head back and laughed harder
than ever. The laughter of a madman. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You've won... You were right! I am yours!&quot; Kivlan screamed,
gazing at the heavily marred grey moon in the sky. &quot;I will prove myself master! I am
yours!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling himself together, Kivlan stepped outside. The
time had come... <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><a href="index.htm">Go Back</a></font></p>
