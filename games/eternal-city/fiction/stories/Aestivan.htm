                                    Related by Dret Rylas as passed down to him by his father and his father 
                                    before him. 
<br><br>
                                    The great city of Mercius, the jewel of the Trancian empire, lay in 
                                    the Fahlidi mountains overlooking a vast plain. Life in the city was that of 
                                    any other large habitation with good times and bad. The people of Trancian 
                                    were ruled by an emperor and his council. They were mostly just and fair, 
                                    but they were lazy and ill informed of the goings on in the surrounding 
                                    lands. Trancian had a huge army, but like the politicians they too were lazy 
                                    and far to laxed in their duties to the people. The people were pompous and 
                                    had neglected their gods for many years, believing that times were good and 
                                    so they didn't need the gods. The gods in return had forsaken the people 
                                    without them knowing it. 
<br><br>
                                    There was, however, a few exceptions to that rule that were diligent 
                                    in their training. These few kept their minds, bodies and spirits fit so 
                                    whatever trials they would face they would be able to overcome; and there 
                                    were bad times rapidly approaching from the horizons. One of these few, a 
                                    warrior by the name of Aestivan Rylas was an exceptional fighter and had 
                                    never been bested. It is said that he had fought one hundred men and won 
                                    without even a scratch. Many believed that the gods favored him and so he 
                                    was envied, but he was kind and well liked by most. 
                                    The dark day came during the games of the harvest festival, when 
                                    most of the cities inhabitants were at the arena, either watching the games 
                                    or selling their wares. From the crest of an adjacent mountain came a 
                                    thunderous noise growing gradually louder until the sound drowned out the 
                                    voices of the thousands who screamed for their champions in the ring. The 
                                    citizens were dumb struck and the soldiers were not prepared. A dark army of 
                                    enormous proportions fell on the city like a plague, filling the streets 
                                    with its fowl contempt for life. The army began to massacre the people of 
                                    Trancian with little resistance from the Trancian soldiers in their futile 
                                    attempt at organizing a suitable defense. The Trancians were being decimated 
                                    and something had to be done. 
<br><br>
                                    Aestivan, seeing that his people and his home were being destroyed, 
                                    prayed to Ardula for strength. It is stated by witnesses that at that moment 
                                    the hand Ardula himself reached from the sky and touched the weapon of 
                                    Aestivan. The warrior took up the axe touched by the gods and waded into the 
                                    fray. He hacked and slashed and felled enemy soldiers at every turn. He had 
                                    slaughtered hundreds of the dark scourge within minutes, but their number 
                                    was too great. Aestivan knew that even blessed, as he was, his strength 
                                    could not hold out. 
<br><br>
                                    Aestivan called to other warriors who had not been lazy and they 
                                    began to gather as many civilians together as they could while he held the 
                                    enemy at bay. When all were gathered that could be Aestivan and the six 
                                    other warriors made a tactical withdrawal up and over the mountains. There 
                                    were so few of them that had escaped that the dark army didn't even bother 
                                    to give chase. They were content with their slaughter and destruction of 
                                    Trancian. 
<br><br>
                                    The small group of people wandered through the mountains for years, 
                                    looking for a suitable land to begin a new life. Just when it seemed that 
                                    the perfect place could not be found the company came out of the mountains 
                                    onto a lush plain of rolling hills. Aestivan and the six other warriors 
                                    formed a league that would govern the people they had led this whole time. 
                                    The league would be disciplined and fair and not be lazy. They learned to 
                                    build structures that would withstand assaults from large numbers of foes 
                                    and they sculpted the lands to their advantage. With so much open land and 
                                    so few citizen, the people who had come to call themselves after the name of 
                                    their great leader Aestivan began to move farther out settling new portions 
                                    of this great place. The league of Aestivan kept tabs on all new settlements 
                                    and any man who called himself lord of his lands still answered to them. 
                                    When Aestivan, the last remaining man to have faith in the old gods, became 
                                    an old man and his time to go to the gods had come he went on a journey. He 
                                    never disclosed his direction or intended destination to anyone he simply 
                                    left. He took with him only the clothes on his back and his great axe that 
                                    had been blessed by the god Ardula. Aestivan was never seen or heard from 
                                    again. It is said that he returned to the city of Trancian to die in the 
                                    place he was born. Others say he went in search of the leader of the dark 
                                    army to kill him. One thing is certain, though, that many Aestivan axe men 
                                    have spent their whole lives searching for the artifact, the Axe of 
                                    Aestivan.
