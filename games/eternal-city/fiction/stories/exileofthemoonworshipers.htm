<h2 align="center">Exile of the Moon Worshipers</h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Reshan</font></p>

<p><font size="2">At the beginning of Iridine's recorded history (1-48), Tulca was king of
Iridine. At this time, there were two main religions in Iridine. The first, sun
worshipping, was widely accepted, and praised Ereal. The second was more evil, and these
people worshipped the moons. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Moon worshipping was practiced by some in the city, and those who
worshipped the moons were hated by the res of the city. Shortly after Tulca became king,
he saw the problems this was causing. He outlawed moon worshipping, and the moon
worshippers were hunted down... </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The few moon worshippers who continued to practice there religion were
hunted down by the followers of Ereal and either banished from the kingdom, or put to
death for their beliefs. This lack of freedom of religion still exists today as followers
of the moon, Ravan, are widely hated and attacked.</font></p>
