<h1>The Future Greatest</h1>

A young man walked through the streets of Iridine one night. He was a young
man, unexperienced, strong, fast, brave, and, sadly, egotistical. Just another of thousands
of man and woman, who came to this city searching for wealth and greatness. But he felt
special, donÌt we all? He felt he was going to be on top in days, that fate would lead him
to his wealth and greatness, like many of himselves before. But he was a mouthy gent, and
decided to act and speak on his greatness, instead of keeping his dreams a simple silent
hope, like so many before him. 
<br><br>
ÏGet out of here! This is my stake! This is my game!Ó said Roquirious.
ÏWhy do I?Ó inquired Joganan. Our hero is found hunting in the sewers, where he
walks in on another manÌs kill, attacking it, an unspoken mortal sin of IridineÌs hunters.
ÏThis is my kill, my stake! ThatÌs my osecar! You damned thief!Ó
ÏGet over it, itÌs just an animal.Ó<br>
ÏItÌs an unwritten rule that you leave peopleÌs areas ALONE!Ó<br>
ÏHey, I wright the rules.Ó<br>
ÏSince when did YOU wright the rules?Ó<br>
The fight contuinued for a while, and Roquirious did not attack Joganan, but gave him a
stern look.<br>
ÏHey, one day, IÌm going to be the best. Just you wait.Ó<br>
Soon, the battle was over, and Roquarious turned towards Joganan.<br>
ÏYou keep opening that lip, and thine ego will kill you.Ó<br>
ÏGet over it, itÌs just a bird. Just you wait, one day, IÌll be the best.Ó<br>
Joganan simply left, and Roquarious stood there. He took little notice of his comments,
Roquarious, and almost took pitty through his anger of his lost kill. He knew that he would
not make it long through life. <br>
The next day, Joganan was still feeling big. He decided he would go to the alleys
for training that night. <br>
ÏGet off my kill! I have this place begon!Ó said Utepe.<br>
ÏItÌs nothing,Ó said Joganan.<br>
ÏItÌ take determination and patience to get a good spot in the alleys,Ó said
Sorririous. The two friends had been hunting in the alleys for hours, with only a thug or 2
brutes to show. <br>
ÏItÌs an unspoken law to take other peopleÌs places,Ó said Utepe in a sad tone.<br>
ÏI live by my own law, Ï said Joganan, ÏSo leave off!Ó<br>
ÏYou know how fast I could kill you,?Ó said Sorririous, ÏYour an ant to us.Ó<br>
ÏIÌll be the greatest one day, youÌll see.Ó said Joganan. <br>
ÏHey Sorririous! Remember your friend telling us about this guy? This ÎBig and
mighty guy who will become the greates?Ó<br>
ÏOh yes! YOu know, he could have killed this guy on his own! Yes, Requarious,
he is only practiced, but he couldÌve made mince-meat out of this guy! HeÌd be sport to
us!Ó<br>
The thug fell unconsious, and Utepe killed him with a stroke of his alanti gladius. Utepe
turned and smiled at Joganan.<br>
ÏIÌll be the best one day, Ï, said Joganan ÏJust you wait!Ó<br>
Utepe and Sorririous began to laugh, and pointed at Joganan as he left. Joganan
just smiled a big, wide smile, and left, also laughing. He knew heÌd be the greatest
someday.
<br><br>
In a week, after Iridine became accostomed to JogananÌs constant braggings, the
egotistical young man went to the portal, to prove his salt. 
ÏHey young man! WhatÌd you doing in the portal?Ó said Yougelse.<br>
ÏIÌm here to train to become the best. Soon, youÌll see, IÌll be the best.Ó<br>
The old man laughed, and laughed. Few men in Iridine would dare give him a dirty
look, less insult him. He was the best of all Iridine. He knew so much, he had to teach
himself new tactics, because he knew everyone elses. The toughest of carrior birds were
no match for Yougelse. 
<br><br>
ÏDonÌt laugh. IÌll be the best. You watch out.Ó said Joganan in a flaunting way.
Yougelse laughed even harder, he amost fell done from pain of his sides. 
A carrion bird came in. Yougelse soon approached it, and began to attack it. 
Joganan, of course, began to join in. Yougelse stopped his attack, and let Joganan take his
turn. Joganan began to be punished for breaking that un-important rule of taking othersÌ
game, without the warrior Yougelse breaking a written one. When Joganan fell
unconsious, Yougelse attacked the bird, and killed it in two hits. Lauging, he drug Joganan
to Vale, leaving him in a much safer place. <br>
A baby alligator crawled up on shore, then killed Joganan, while he was
unconsious. The great Joganan. Just then, another new warrior approached. He took the
armor Joganan stole from his former collegueÌs kills, and stood motionless.
<br><br>
ÏFool. Failure, you are nothing like me, for one day I will become the greatest.Ó
