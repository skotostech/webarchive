The following story is true and the names have not been changed. Though facts my have become distorted through time. 
<br><br>
<center>**************<br><br></center>
Where are the death threats? The hate the angry, I was a Warlord in the land of my most hated enemy and yet I survived. If the situation was reversed an Iridinian Officer would have been killed on sight but why? Why was I still alive? Kurgen's thoughts were shot back to reality when he heard someone yelling from outside,&quot; Legion is gladly Accepting recruits, all able-bodied men please sign up and protect your Republic!&quot; Kurgen thought for a moment and realized you can take a soldier out of the country but not the soldier out of the man. Kurgen just shruged,&quot;Why join that pathetic excuse for an army anyways?&quot; Until another thought clicked into his head. Use his outstanding military knowledge to help get revenage on Cinera by using Iridine's Legio! Yes, that would work, that idea would really work! 
<br><br>

<i>Later at the Legio Recruitment meeting<i></center>
<br><br>
The Centurion looked down the line of men and women after he had taken all their names. Kurgen was among them but little did they know of their enemy standing there. Kurgen did take time to notice the men and woman around him. One woman stood out a one he had heard called Cembre but she appeared taken by a strong warrior named Thain. Besides Kurgen was married already, but her face looked oddly familair and he could feel that he would some how get in trouble and she would be involved. It was a short time later when Kurgen made a choice, he decided to come clean of his former occupation to get the load of his chest.&quot;Sir, I... I think you should know this, but I was once a Cineran Warlord who just so happened to have been removed from his position,&quot; Kurgen said. The centurion chuckled for a moment and said, &quot;We have place for turncoats in our armies.&quot; Kurgen took a step back from the line alittle worried about fighting all of the people gathered. Kurgen then thought about all he could do, show the secret enterance into Cinera the capital city and ways around the guards to the king himself. Kurgen waited while thinking and nothing happened to him so he just settled back in. A few things happened after that but nothing of importance to Kurgen, so his training continued. 
<br><br>

 Sometimes later Kurgen awoke from his temporary sleeping headquarters and saw Sindal standing before him with something in her arms. &quot;Sindal? how did you get here, you shouldn't be here.&quot; said Kurgen still dazed from sleep.&quot;I had to come, I had to show you your son,&quot; said Sindal handing the small bundle of cloth to him. &quot;My son?&quot; asked Kurgen looking down at the child and seeing his cold dark eyes looking back.&quot;Our son,&quot; said Sindal kissing her husband. 
<br><br>

&quot;What will I do? I can't support a family on my income, I can barely support myself,&quot; thought Kurgen to himself as he marched along with his group to battle. Kurgen jumped almost into the air when he started hearing the battle cries. This time instead of Kurgen jumping right in and swinging his gladius he stopped in his tracks. He became stiff as a statue. If anyone had looked into his eyes they would have seen an inner conflict going on. Now Kurgen was thinking not of his family or the Legio, he was fighting the Warlord inside him. His only enemy to follow him anywhere was trying to take control again. Kurgen fought with all his might trying to hold it back when he saw a figure fall infront of him. The person he had met, Cembre. She had fallen unconsious. Forgeting his own battle and letting his mental guards down he charged over to the fallen Cembre. he realized here he could do nothing so he dragged her from the battle. He dragged back into a small hut near the battlefield. Inside he knew they would be safe. Kurgen said softly to Cembre,&quot; I'm going to tell you something I have never told anyone else, I know alittle healing. My mother taught me but I have always kept it hidden away from everyone.&quot; Kurgen checked over her and saw she was totally unconsious with her eyes shut tight. This time his defenses weren't ready and the Warlord came charging in to take over.&quot;I don't have any bandages so I'm going to see if you have any,&quot; said Kurgen to Cembre as he took her sack. Instead of looking for the bandages he grabbed the sack and poured it into his and ran. He ran and ran looking for any refugee. Then he saw the temple of Ereal and ran inside. There he slept and the Warlord once again fell back into waiting as Kurgen bent before a statue of Ereal. &quot;Ereal why won't you take this demon from me!&quot; yelled Kurgen at the statue.No answer came as Kurgen fell into deep sleep. 
<br><br>
<center>***************<br><br></center>
Kurgen awoke sometimes later to hear the sound of a city hunting him. Cembre had some how seen him while she was unconsious with her eyes shut. No matter it was Thain who was the worsest. He would hunt Kurgen to the ends of the earth never stopping. His property had been stolen from and now he had to take revenagence. Kurgen pleaded with the people and told them of his child but with no luck. Thain and Cembre had closed the ears of the people and they would not listen even to the cries of a child. Kurgen sent the money and every possession he had except for his armor and gladius by deliever to his wife and son. He walked out the back door of the temple and didn't look back. His life here was over he had no where to go no one to go too. He said good bye to two countries as he headed south to find death alone as a demon like him deserved. Kurgen never returned to Iridine. He never saw the rise and fall of the Black Dragon, never saw Kivlan turn into the hideous monster he became. Never saw his child become a man and his wife slowly die of sickness. He never saw the second Cineran-Iridinian War. He never saw his enemy Thain and Cembre break up with each other. He never saw... He never did return, a few men have claimed relation to him, some even say he is the child of Kurgen. Some pretend they are Kurgen but never did he return. NEVER... 
<br><br>

 I guess it was impossible, enemies can not live together. Snakes can not live with rats, dogs can not live with cats. Cinerans could not work and raise families with Iridinians. What had I ever done, my dark side my evil force, the Warlord, what ever you wish to call it, my only true enemy, but my only true friend. If not for the Warlord I would have died and yet I would have lived. Every inch of my body tells me my error with the incident with Cembre, I should have killed the woman and saved the trouble, but ever inch also says you should have just left her be. Now, Kurgen Destroyer of Dreams has lived up to his name. He destroyed the most important dream in the world. He destroyed Kurgen's Dream. The one dream never to be fixed. Of course I did survive my encounter in Iridine, I did walk on but every step I took part of my soul stayed behind, I lost some in Cinera and I lost all but one thread in Iridine. What will become of this one thread? That is another story in another place. Kurgen, Destroyer of Dreams Warlord of the Kyus.
