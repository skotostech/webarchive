<h1 align="center">Kurgen On Culladien Island</h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">By Long47</font></p>

<p align="left">&quot;They are on their way here Kurgen, It won't be long until they
arrive and hunt you,&quot; said the voice in Kurgen's head. Ever since the sand clung
together and brought his towering, dark form to Culliaden that voice had been after him.
&quot;I know their are coming you fool,&quot; Kurgen said aloud. Kurgen managed to get
quiet again as he saw the Cineran patrol looking back his way. &quot;They are coming to
kill you, Warlord Kurgen, they will not fail,&quot; said the voice more demanding.
&quot;Enough of this!&quot; yelled Kurgen charging from underneath his hiding place.
&quot;Bow and arrows,&quot; yelled Kurgen at his gladius as the shimmering green began to
change. Kurgen fired the arrows, they streaked across the air nailing each patrolmen in
chest.&quot;They come to kill you....&quot;</p>

<p align="center">*************</p>

<p align="left">&quot;Sir, the magical man took one of our patrols today,&quot; said a
sargent to his commander. &quot;I can't believe this, that is what, the second or third
patrol just this week!&quot; said the commander very angry, &quot;Take 100 or so men and
kill him, I don't care what it takes. With this war we can't afford losing men, NOW
GO!&quot; &quot;Are you sure that is wise commander. I sense this magic force he has, it
comes from his god. We of course know Ravan the stronger, I believe I shall send some
birds to hunt this man down, No wait, I have it. I shall send the Trynrat after him, he
couldn't beat that,&quot; said a man stepping from behind the shadows. &quot;Fine do
whatever, but this man has to die,&quot; said the commander not even willing to look up at
him. The man just smiled</p>

<p align="center">**************</p>

<p align="left">Kurgen sat quietly in the tree eating a recently killed snake.
&quot;Troubled my son,&quot; came the familair voice of Kurgen's mentor. &quot;You could
say that I guess, its just its hard to do what I was sent to do with this voice bothering
me, who or what is it?&quot; asked Kurgen sincerely. &quot;It my friend is a ghost telling
you the truth. We are not the only ones seek answers for Moonfall, and some of the other
gods and goddess won't care for you to much,&quot; said the man quietly. &quot;So the
ghost is a friend then?&quot; asked Kurgen looking at his friend. &quot;That I am not sure
of, but I guess time will tell. Right now I would worry about Iridine as your friends from
there are so many,&quot; said the mentor chuckling. &quot;They won't come here for
answers, Iridinians and Altenians have always been full of themselves, thinking their
great nations hold the answers for everything,&quot; said Kurgen chuckling with his
friend. They were interrupted by the ground rumbling under their feet. &quot;Here comes a
challenge boy, enjoy,&quot; said the man throwing his hand up and disappearing.
&quot;Typical move by him,&quot; said Kurgen sliding down out of the tree. Kurgen wished
he had stayed up there when he saw the beast, 9 feet tall and 10 feet wide, it was all
muscle and was almost human in appearance, except for the dark skin and the ravanite eyes.
&quot;Greetings I am Kurgen, Bringer of Peace, and who are you?&quot; asked Kurgen. A foot
stomping launched at him was his answer. Kurgen barely dodging it, pulled forth his
gladius and charged forward. Kurgen rammed his gladius into the skin to have it only
turned back as if he had stabbed a mail cuirass of iron. Kurgen then began slashes, still
having no effect. &quot;This is bad,&quot; said Kurgen barely dodging a large hand dropped
towards him. Kurgen then used his speed and managed to crawl up onto the creature's back.
&quot;Day worthless scum,&quot; yelled Kurgen jamming his gladius into the creature's eye
and up into his brain. &quot;That was easy,&quot; laughed Kurgen until the ground shook.
&quot;Not another one,&quot; said Kurgen, but he wasn't that lucky. He looked down the
ground had opened up, swallowing him and the monster, but to where?</p>
