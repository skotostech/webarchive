<p>Petra, Lucien and myself were at the Stone Toga when Tivarrus arrived. Tivarrus is a
Altene mercenary who was part of the band that was defeated by rogue elements of Altene's
called the Nightdevils. This defeat resulted in the loss of the patrician Verulus, as well
as Tivarrus' Captain. While Tivarrus speaks little to no Common or Iridinian, we were
fortunate that he spoke some Tuchean which Petra was able to translate for us. Tivarrus
told us of an abstract being called &quot;Him&quot; and how he followed him. He also asked
us for Quintus, and was most eager to find him. We eventually worked out that Tivarrus was
under the control of a Gideon who appeared to be a priest of Ravan. </p>

<p>Tivarrus wanted to take us to Gideon, but we needed to be blindfolded and leave our
weapons behind. He eventually capitulated and allowed us to hide our weapons, but insisted
that we were blindfolded. After a short travel, we ended up in a passageway underneath a
building. Tivarrus said, &quot;He is returned, &quot; to a newly built wall and slowly it
slid opened. We walked into a larger cavern and came upon a altar as well as a group of
citizens, women of the night, and beggars. One faced flashed out as it was the face of
Caia, the daughter of Caius, who some of us saved from the island not too long ago. Gideon
was masked and we could not make out many characteristics, however he is a very menacing
man. </p>

<p>Knowing that we were in a very bad situation, three against a whole host, we decided to
act as mercenaries looking to sell Quintus to this group so that we could escape and
return with the authorities.. Gideon asked us if we wished to become one of them, we
declined say we were not religious and just seeking coins. We negotiated for awhile and
Gideon would not relent to let us take Tivarrus and Caia hostage, until we return with
Quintus and he paid us. This Gideon seemed to be able to slip into somebody's mind, as he
tried to do to me several times, and control others through manipulating their minds.
Knowing that we could not leave them down here, we acted by attacking Gideon. After a few
cuts, Gideon fled the scene. </p>

<p>The spell cast over the people seemed to weaken, but all fled save for Caia before we
could convince them to stay with us. We carried Caia to the Harbor Temple and left her in
the hands of a priestesss named Alicia. We still look for Tivarrus and greatly fear his
well-being. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>
