<h2 align="center">He slightly turned and said... </h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Pascal Dansereau</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Unseeing eyes of disturbed sleep . . .</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Ravan of the Realm of Shades approached the lone figure sitting on a
nearby rock, surrounded by endless fields of rich green grass. He paused within arms reach
of the woman calmly resting in front of him, observing her with something approaching
warmth for him. She had long coppery hair streaked silver pleasing to the eyes. Her face
was turned away from him at the moment but he knew that had she been looking at him he
would have seen agelessness and deep wisdom in a face speaking of great knowledge mixed
with infinite beauty. Time's own eyes were dangerous, even for one such as he, Ravan the
Unraveller. He showed no surprise witnessing her in the shape of her children, the
earthbound. That shape was now cloaked in a long flowing robe of sky blue with ribbons of
pure white, like a cloud pattern passing by. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Humans, so much weakness and limitations yet so appealing. Their senses,
their perception, pleasure and pain, all so intoxicating. Ravan the Ancient himself was
now in such form, looking at the landscape he finally spoke. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Helia.&quot; He said in a raspy but not unpleasant voice. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">She had seemed oblivious to his arrival, showing no sign of even knowing
he was there. Now even after he spoke, Helia of the White Hands did not react. She had
been aware of his presence for some time already, just like she knew he could sense her.
The silence stretched when finally she leaned her head to the side, not quite turning
toward him. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Ravan, your thoughts are chaos, do your tasks trouble you
so?&quot; She said in a musical voice. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Ravan allowed himself a smile. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Nay lady, death suits me fine.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">This time she did turn completely toward him, fixing her gaze on him,
her eyes were the color of the earth, calm. He had taken the shape of a tall, large man,
his hair was the color of smoke but his features where those of someone in his prime. His
hands were hidden in the sleeves of his ample grey cloak which covered his body and was
tied only by a simple rope belt. He returned her gaze his eyes dark. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Why have you come?&quot; Helia the Giver asked him. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Do I need a reason?&quot; Was his response after a time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;No.&quot; The musical voice conceded. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Again silence stretched out, yet neither shape seemed bothered. Helia of
All Seasons was contemplating something only her eyes could see while Ravan her consort
watched her with his midnight eyes. A trio of bluebirds formed on the horizon coming
quickly. The space before the two shapes was suddenly filled by a riot of movement and
sharp thrills of excited birds. One of the bluebirds landed on the outstretched hand of
the Mother, gracing her with his exuberant singsong. A second bird landed deftly on the
shoulder of the unconcerned Gray Man, immediately it shuddered and turned ghostly white
before taking off again. A spasm of pain marred Helia's feature before she let her hand
fall. All three birds, two blue and one white, turned as one and left for the horizon
whence they came from. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Must it be . . .&quot; Helia asked, her eyes briefly closing for a
deep breath. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Ravan took a step forward as she rose from her seat, their surroundings
blurred . . . </font></p>

<p><font size="2">They were standing in a long hallway made of large cut stone. The grey
stone was remarkably shaped by what must have been very skillful hands indeed, the wall
rose to a dizzy height curving until opposing walls touched to form the vaulted ceiling
above. One wall, the one Helia of the Mysterious Smile was facing, had thin windows at
regular intervals of a few feet through which a brilliance shone. This wall also had
banners between each opening on which could be seen scenes from the lives of humans, each
banner stopped inches above a plain wooden door. The opposing wall also contained windows,
one section removed from its facing counterpart, no light here but darkness occasionally
disturbed by a silvery flash. Where the banners should have been, lists of names written
in runic symbols could be seen. These symbols also stopped inches from a plain wooden
door. This was the Hall of Time and Memory. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Welcome to my home.&quot; Ravan Lord of the Dead rasped sketching
a graceful bow. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Helia Mistress of Life chuckled softly. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Has Invex or the others bent their heads to you my dear? Surely
they have as much claim to this place as you.&quot; She said lightly although her eyes had
gained the quality of troubled waters. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The others,&quot; he snorted. &quot;Aera and Lucifal are fond of
this shape and concern themselves too much of the humans, involving themselves in their
affairs so that they can't tend the Hall.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Ravan paused to consider the shape in front of him before going on. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Invex is not far behind his brethren when it comes to walking the
earth, that is when the fool is not at your feet or Aera's, blind to his
surroundings.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Helia cut him off, fiery red streaks showing in her eternal eyes,
&quot;Do not make the mistake of considering him weak, Ravan, and memory does belong to
him.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The Unraveller simply shrugged. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">They were interrupted as a shape appeared within the Hall. It was what
appeared to be a young boy, his eyes were large with fright and focused on something
neither of them could see but both knew what it was. The boy started running down the Hall
as fast as short legs could take him, driven by emotion. At last he wasn't fast enough,
turning he yelled once before being hurled across the passage by an unseen force striking
the darker wall. The shape vanished. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It wasn't his time.&quot; The musical voice said, sadness apparent
in her voice. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;No, one of us intervened.&quot; Ravan stated coldly. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Helia only nodded to the obvious, her eyes were locked on a previously
blank space on the wall were a runic name was drawing itself. The Hall of Memory and Time
was momentarily flooded with light and color which disappeared with the far away sound of
a door opening and closing. A single tear trickled down her ivory cheek. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;All come to me eventually great Helia. Warriors die, beauty and
love is lost, even dreams eventually end. This is my doorstep.&quot; He said the last with
a quick gesture to mask a sudden spasm at the thought of Lucifal the Shadow. He knew it
was futile because his thoughts would have betrayed him but he nevertheless repeated to
himself that all came to him in due time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Be careful Ravan, even we are not immune against madness.&quot;
She warned. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Caught off guard, he barked out a sudden sharp laugh. The sound carried
easily up the vaulted ceiling and down the stone hall. When it finally died down it had
gained a disturbing quality. As the last notes of his mirth danced off the stones, Helia's
eyes flashed, glancing sharply at Ravan the Unraveller. </font></p>
