<p><font size="2">&quot;It started with a kidney, but before the kidney there was a rock.
Actually, before the rock there was a rainstorm where Aban helped me knock off the first
mate. But after that there was collecting all that driftwood in the rain.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The guy started telling the story, and if I hadn't known him, I would've
thought he was drunk. He wasn't drunk, though- just really weird, like almost crazy-weird,
but not quite. Listening to his story would've been hell, too, except that other Windward
guy leaned forward with all his weight and punched the crazy guy hard in the back, and all
the air whooshed out of the crazy guy's lungs, and he, I mean the crazy guy, he just sort
of started gasping, because he couldn't breathe, and it probably hurt a lot, too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Gasp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You tell 'im dat story right if you're gonna tell 'im at
all,&quot; complained the first guy. I expected the crazy guy to get all angry, but he
didn't. He just shook his head.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Gasp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Dere ain't no reason to go fakin' like dat. I diddin hit you dat
hard.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Gasp. &quot;I...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Go on. Tell dat man de story.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Gasp. &quot;... can't...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The little guy clenched his fist and made like he was gonna hit the
crazy guy again. The crazy guy immediately sat up straight, grinned, and started talking
in a completely normal voice.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">* * * </font></p>

<p><font size="2">All of us have our separate stories. We all came from different places
and different backgrounds, and none of us really had anything much in common with the
others, except by chance. I guess if you want me to tell 'our' story instead of 'my'
story, the place to start is in Iridine.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Why I came to Iridine and what I was doing down by the docks at that
time of night definitely fall into the category of 'my' story rather than 'our' story, so
I'll save that tale for another time. Suffice it to say that I was stupid enough to be
walking alone and naive enough to think that a cry for help in the dark was a chance for
me to be a hero and deaf enough that I didn't hear them sneaking up behind me until the
last second and slow enough that by then, I couldn't do anything about it. I managed to
turn most of the way around before the club hit me on the temple. It was heavy and the guy
swung it hard, so I should've gone out right away, but I didn't. I keeled over, twisting
around as I fell just long enough for me to glimpse the dizzily spinning image of a man
giving a kid a silver coin. My face hit the cobblestones, chin first, and I groaned. I
lifted myself up on my elbows, blood streaming down into my eyes, just long enough to see
the kid screaming, &quot;Please, somebody please help me!&quot; again before an explosion
of stars collided with the back of my head and transported me to hell.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">* * * </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;A silver coin is all that stands between you and a lifetime of
slavery. Don't forget that, Octavio.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The little guy muttered, &quot;Dat's gotta be da stupidest thing you
ever said.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;No it's not. What about the time I said, 'It's just a darned
rock!'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Rock?&quot; I asked, confused.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You had to be there,&quot; said the crazy guy by way of
explanation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Just get on wit da story,&quot; scowled the little guy. The first
guy's jaw worked a couple of times like he was just dying to say something else, but
finally he just shook his head and continued talking while the little guy muttered under
his breath about idiots.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">* * * </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I woke up chained to a wooden bench, rusty iron manacles binding my
wrists and ankles to the wall. I was naked except for a loincloth, and Aban was chained up
right beside me. There were some other guys chained up behind some big crates, but we
couldn't really see them except to see that they were in no better a predicament than we.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Aban immediately began trying to work his manacles free from the wall. I
started whimpering. I just sort of sat there and whined for a while, and then, after a
couple of hours, I decided to cry for variety, silent sobs shaking my body and tears
streaming down my dirty cheeks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">It didn't take us long to realize that we were in a slave ship. The
sailors were more than happy to tell us of our predicament and taunt us with food and
water. After a while they came down and started looking for women, but there weren't any
around, so they used Aban to satisfy themselves. * * *</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The little guy thwapped the crazy guy on the back of the head.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Well, they almost did.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thwap.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;A couple of them were looking at your butt.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Lookin' ain't touchin'.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Whatever.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">* * * </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Anyway, we were in the hold of that slave ship for several days, me
pretty much whining the whole time and Aban trying to get free. They never let us loose,
not even to piss, but luckily for us they gave us so little to eat and drink that we
didn't have to do that very often anyway. Let's just say that the hold of that slave ship
was dirty and crowded and it stank. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Even though I spent my time just sitting there and Aban spent the whole
time struggling to get free, we both made pretty much the same progress- that is to say,
none. These were Cinerians, and, as everyone knows by now, the Cinerians know their
slaving. Those manacles were locked closed tight and there was no way Aban was gonna get
them loose by tugging on them any more than I was by crying on them. Every once in a while
the sailors would come by and whip us for a while, just for kicks, and Aban would try to
kill them, just for kicks, and they would kick him, just for- for fun. It would've
probably gone on that way forever if it hadn't been for the storm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">We knew it was coming as soon as the captain did, pretty much. The
captain was a bully, coming down into the hold frequently to torment us and throw water on
the floor so he could watch us lap it up. He liked the whip and he liked to kick, and Aban
and I both got our share of each. But when the storm came, he just got all crazy. At first
he started screaming about killing all the slaves because they were the reason the sea
gods were going to kill him. Aban got all panicky then and started trying to explain that
there aren't any sea gods, but the captain wasn't hearing it. His crew restrained him and
dragged him back to the deck, because, after all, sorry as we were by then, we were their
salary. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We couldn't see the lightning down in the hold, but we could hear the
thunder. Every time it went off it sent echoes of that club on the docks dancing through
my head again. The whole ship shook, and it started swinging wildly to one side, wind and
water making it list over to the leeward until I was certain that it would capsize. For
hours the ship tossed and turned, and I was so sick that if I'd had anything to eat for
the past three days, I would've lost it then.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">And then, like a miracle, out of nowhere, there was a sickening thud as
the ship hit something. Aban and I were thrown back against our chains, and if we hadn't
been attached to the wall by iron, we would've cracked our skulls on the inside of the
hold. As it was, my right wrist was nearly jerked out of the socket and my shoulder got
dislocated. I pushed it back in, though. I can do that. So could you, really. All you have
to do is hold it like this, and then slam...</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">* * * </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Aban growled at the crazy guy and the crazy guy rolled his eyes and went
back to the story.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">* * * </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Anyway, a huge rock... huh? Oh, reef. Whatever. A huge something tore
right through the bottom part of the ship, and the ship slammed down hard onto it. Water
started gushing into the hold like crazy, and in seconds we were ankle-deep in icy water.
Thunder clapped again, and the wind rose and the water heaved and in a moment we were over
the rock. Reef. We were floating again. Sort of. With all the water that was gushing into
the hold, the ship wasn't responding very well, wobbling sluggishly back and forth. About
two minutes later, the captain came down, all crazy and wild-eyed again. I swear he
couldn't see us. I don't know why he even came down into the hold. I started blubbering
again that he should free us before we all drowned, but the captain didn't pay any
attention to me. Then Aban said something about letting us loose so we could bail the ship
out and sail it in for repairs, and that got the captain's attention. I don't know how the
captain could be so crazy as to think this ship was going to sail anywhere. It was going
down fast, and any idiot could see that, but the captain was so desperate that he was
crazy, and so he let me free. I climbed up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, and in a
minute the captain let some other guy free. The other guy skewered the captain dead with
his own dagger and then took the keys to the manacles away from him and let Aban free.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">There were around fifty of us crammed into that little hold. I didn't
know most of them, and most of their names I never learned, because most of them died in
the next few minutes. I ran wildly around the ship, basically just trying not to get swept
off the deck by the wind and the water. To tell you the truth, I still don't know why I
didn't get tossed into the sea sooner. After about five minutes I saw an eerie orange glow
coming from across the deck of the ship. I dragged myself over there, using the tatters of
the sails and fallen rigging to keep from getting swept overboard. When I finally got to
the doorway, what seemed like hours later, there was Aban, locked in mortal combat with
the first mate. They were going back and forth, Aban holding his gladius like an old pro
and the first mate darting in and out with a fighting-dirk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The orange light, it turned out, was coming from a fallen lantern which
had spilled burning oil out all over the captain's cabin. I had to wonder, though, why in
this time of trouble the first mate had run for the captain's cabin instead of saving
himself. At first it was just a passing curiosity, but then, considering, I looked around,
and, spying a fallen dagger, I seized my opportunity and used the dagger to pry the lock
off of the captain's chest.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The mate was furious, suddenly ignoring Aban and lunging at me. I opened
the chest, pulling a wooden box and a couple of sacks out of it. Aban saved my life then,
but he took the knife meant for my back in the meat of his fighting arm, and he nearly
dropped the gladius. Nearly, but not quite. Aban will drop his head before his gladius,
and I swear that's the gods' honest truth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Well, the captain was dead, the first mate wanted my head, and the ship
was sinking. What was there to do but grab a whole bunch of heavy boxes and sacks and drag
them back out onto the deck, Aban covering me by driving the first mate back?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">And when I got out onto the deck the wind nearly knocked
me overboard, so I clung to the heavy box just so I didn't get swept away, and then the
first mate and Aban came out of the cabin, locked in combat to the death, and I could only
watch as a wave swept them both into the sea and then knocked me into the sea and I
remembered no more. <br>
<br>
* * *</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;But you lived,&quot; I said to the crazy man, and he laughed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Yeah, we lived, or we wouldn't be here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Well what happened? How did you survive?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;That, my friend, is a long story, and it requires another
drink.&quot; I ran off to pour a drink for him, and at the same time I asked, &quot;So
what was in the box, anyway?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some dried meat. Letters to be delivered in Cinera. Parchment and
some seals. A few weapons. Trousers. A belt. Bandages, thread, and needles for
surgery.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, carrying the ale over to the table. &quot;You
see, I would've thought there would be some money and a few jewels in that pouch. Ship's
captains generally need money to pay the sailors when they get to shore. I'm surprised you
didn't find anything like that in there.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The crazy man looked uncomfortable. &quot;Just the beef,&quot; he argued
lamely, but a dark look was growing in Aban's eye.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I swear.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Aban said nothing, but I could tell that he would.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Bennett, we gotta talk.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I'm not done with the story?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You drunk enough. Let's you and me go outside. We can finish this
story another time.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Hey,&quot; I interrupted, &quot;you can't leave me hanging like
that. How did you survive the shipwreck?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;He'll tell you another time. Right now dere's some business him
an' me's gotta discuss.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;But at least tell me about the kidney,&quot; I begged.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Later. Bennett here's had enough to drink already for one day. Oh.
Don't tell anyone what we told you.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Why not?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We don't want anyone to know.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;If you don't want anyone to know, why did you tell me?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Because you won't blab.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;How can you know that?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Because we know you. Don't tell anyone. Not even your wife.
Promise.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; I said. &quot;I promise. Geez. It's not that
interesting.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It will be,&quot; promised Bennett, but right around then Aban
dragged him out the ear by his door, and that was the end of that.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I was tempted to talk, but I didn't, because I'd promised, but I
couldn't help wondering how they knew that I wouldn't break that promise. I found out
later, but that's a different part of the story.</font></p>
