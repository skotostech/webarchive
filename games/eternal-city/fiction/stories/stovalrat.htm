<h1 align="center">Corvus - The Ratslayer</h1>

<p align="left"><font size="2">By Stovall</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">It was a cold, rainy day in the city of Iridine when Corvus
Pius, healer and adventurer, </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">earned the name 'Ratslayer'. There are some wish he did not
have the title, as they think it is a </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">mockery. After all, despite a sewer rat's lack of killing
ability, Corvus is hard pressed to fight and </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">win against one. Those who know the story, however, know
that the name is a mark of honor. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">But I am off the subject..... </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">As I said, twas cold that day in Iridine, and those who
live there went about their busines </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">in the usual fashion. One of these people, a yound
swordsman whose name escpaes me, did </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">most of his business in the sewers, sharpening his skill
against myriad vermin. Luck was not with </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">him that day. He was swarmed by the creatures he hunted,
managing to escape only after </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">sustaining several grevious wounds. He was weakened
terribly by loss blood, and soon passed </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">from consciousness. Somehow, his desperate thoughts of
escape were sensed by Ebon </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Blackore. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Ebon's first thought was to rush immediatley to the young
warriors aid. Unfourtunatley, </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">his arm had been smashed by a Cineran soldier earlier in
the day, and the Parcince clubsman </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">didn't fancy trying to carry someone with the still painful
wounds he'd sustained. He went to The </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Stone Toga Inn, hoping to find a healer willing to
accompany him. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">There, sitting in a weary old chair, was Corvus Pius. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Ebon quickly explained the situation, and asked if the
young healer would help. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Whipping out the tin pigsticker riding his hip, Corvus
simply said: &quot;Sure!&quot; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">And so they went, descending into the wretched filth of
Iridine's sewers and racing after </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">the dying man. The Eternal City's underground was alive
with hungry, ill-fed creatures that </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">sought them out, but all were crushed by Ebon's heavy club.
Soon they found the wounded </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">swordsman, bleeding and close to death. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Corvus set to work, and soon the dying man's wounds were
bound, though he would </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">need further treatment. Though they tried, neither Corvus
nor Ebon could carry the fellow, and </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">so they waited, willing the injured swordsman to wake. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Then the shadow's began to move. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">A horde of vermin swarmed in, their appetites whetted by
the scent of blood. Two were </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">quickly smited by Ebon's club, but more came, too many for
the stocky Parcine to handle alone. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Corvus leapt into the fray, and the battle commenced, sword
and club tearing through the osecar </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">and rats as the two men to keep the vile creatures off the
unconscious man. Fatigue set in </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">quickly, but soon the last beast fell, hitting the ground
almost to the second that the injured </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">swordsman woke. With little hesitation, the small band
headed back towards the surface. It was </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">then that things went truly awry, for as Ebon gripped the
ladder that led to saftey, he saw that </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Corvus was no longer with him. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Sending the injured swordsman up, Ebon began to search for
the wayward healer, but </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">his efforts were fruitless. With few torches and slowed by
wounds and fatigue, it wasn't long </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">before the Parcine clubsman was forced to make his own
retreat. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Unbeknownst to Ebon, young Corvus lay in an anonymous
section of tunnel, his body </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">wracked by some foul bug given him by a rat's filthy bite.
The sickness set in rapidly, and, as </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">he slept, fever tormented his body. Fading in and out of
consciousness, he nevertheless had the </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">prescence of mind to crawl onto a stone platform, out of
the reach of any sewer creatures. He </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">forced himself to eat, and swallowed some healing herbs
given him by Fiona. Hours passed </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">before his fever broke, but break it did. Still queasy and
covered in sweat, the healer lit his only </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">torch, gripped his sword tightly, and began to search for
the way out. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Soon Corvus was beset by the beasts of the sewers. but,
being an intelligent sort, he </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">refused to battle them. Not knowing the sewers as well as
most, it took him much time to find his </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">way, but soon the walls around him began to look familiar.
His heart rose, as he knew he was </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">close to safety. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">But it fell again as his only torch suddenly winked out. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Holding back panic, he felt his way along, hoping to find
the clean stone of the exit </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">tunnel. He was close, very close, when the low growl of an
osecar reached his ears and the </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">squeaking voice of rats began to twitter behind him. The
hot kiss of unfriendly teeth found his </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">thigh, and the fight was on, the young healer slashing
wildly, aiming by sound or the glint of his </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">attacker's eyes. Many times he felt his blade pierce flesh,
but many more times did he feel </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">claws and teeth rend him. He fought on, not knowing where
to run, until even more vermin </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">swarmed in. Seeing their shadow's slink in, he ran past
them, for they had shown him the way. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">The soft muck under his boots soon turned to old stone, but
one of his hungry assailants </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">had followed. The rat attacked, and again Corvus lost his
bearings. Slashing and thrusting at his </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">tenacious pursuer, the young healer was as suprised as the
rat when his blade peirced the </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">rodent's heart. In the distance he heard more beasts
approaching, and he ran north, down the </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">exit tunnel and into the safety of the warehouse we all
know. It was there that I found him, </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">bleeding and filthy with his bloody sword beside him. He
wrapped his last bandage around his </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">torn thigh as I entered, looked up at me and said: &quot;I
killed a rat!&quot; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">As if that were the whole story. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">He told me some of what had happened as I walked him to
Fiona's. His voice was </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">taught, excited, and he repeated periodically &quot;I
killed a rat!&quot;, like that was something truly grand. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">It wasn't until I talked to Ebon that the extent of Corvus'
valor was told. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">To some, our name for Corvus may still seem mocking. Others
may say he has done </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">more noteworthy things since, or that the name is not
appropriate for one so devoted to healing. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">It is true that Corvus Pius may chose to study the arts of
swordplay and come to battle things far </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">deadlier than an Iridian sewer rat. Or he may devote his
life further to the healing arts, and </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">never draw blade against another living thing. Regardless
of circumstance, to those of us who </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">remember the bravery shown on that rainy winter's day in
Iridine, he will always remain Corvus, </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">The Ratslayer. </font></p>
