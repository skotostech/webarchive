<h1>
Heir to the Gladius, part 1</h1></center>

<br>
<p><font size=-1>A man's legacy, the only thing left behind after a man
has departed. I may have become the Bringer of Peace, champion of justice,
trying to bring back the old gods and goddess. Those of the Moon, who are
not all evil, those of the sun, the earth, the stars, the sky, and most
beloved among them all to me, Dycrus. My legacy is not that though, as
it should be, mine is a of hate and pain, of sorrow and death. I can see
my legacy's work when I step by a farmhouse, children coware in fear, women
run to protect their babies, men arm themselves and chase me down the roads.
I could easily killed them, after all I am Kurgen, trained in the arts
of war and leadership. I have seen and killed more men then most well ever
see. I would find it no problem to dispatch those of lesser skill, save
the fact I answer to someone higher then me. I allow them their chance
ot brag of their chasing away the 'Great Destroyer of Dreams'. The only
thing that hurt is I know bards will not sing the song of how I myself
alone with my green gladius defeat Ravan incarnate, they will not tell
of my adventures but of my sorrows. Unless an heir is choosen...</font>

<p><font size=-1>****** "You can see him can't you?" questioned the muscular
man stepping through the door. "Of course father," said a younger, more
slendar man staring out a window. Even from the highest tower from this
mighty castle the magical cloak could be seen in the village. Many a soldier
had been wasted trying to stop him, someone where killed, others converted.
This strange man with magical powers was unbeatable. "Bringer of Peace
is what they chant now, not the name of their King Fryqust, as they should,"
said the boy turning from the window. "An unarmed man will conquer our
small kingdom in Avestia, your family established this kingdom and he destroys
it," said the man spitting out the window wishing he was brave enough to
do it to the man's face. "It was said his cloak can change to any armor
he needs and his hands are like unto hardened swords..." said the boy only
to have a yell interrupt him. "DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND, HE WILL KILL US ALL,
ALL IN THE NAME OF DYCRUS!" yelled Fryqust hoping he would be heard," NEVER
EVER GO NEAR HIM BOY, LEAST HE TURN EVEN YOU AGAINST ME!" He just stormed
out of the room, leaving his son in utter shock. He knew, his father was
scared, scared out of his mind. ***** Kurgen may have never heard the yell
but the doves, servant of Dycrus did. They made sure their master's only
remaining servant got the word. "I bring peace as Dycrus commands, I don't
even carry a weapon," exclaimed an annoyed Kurgen to himself. "The king
cares not, you threat him with words and not swords, he doesn't know how
to fight them," said the old man appearing from no where. "I wasn't aware
I addressed the question to you," snapped Kurgen. "I guide you through
your entire life of service and this is the respect I get!" exclaimed the
man feigning angry. "Yes, but tell me, who will you guide when my bones
are nothing more then dust blowing on the breeze?" questioned Kurgen with
a smile returning to his severe face. "I don't know, some warlord with
his way lost. I might guide him through the forest of Parcines and show
him to the old temples, maybe he'll learn there," joked the man with a
laugh. "There will never be another like me," laughed Kurgen with a sly
grin. "And there has never been another like me, Dycrus doesn't like everyone
being exactly the same after all," laughed the man sitting down. "I guess,
but when is it my turn to teach, I still grow quite old..." Kurgen tried
to say but a hand silenced him. "Your answer is about to walk right through
that door," said the man as the door burst open. "Two against ten, pretty
even odds," counted Kurgen, though he didn't need to turn to see his friend
gone, again. "I am the King's son Trinamin, surrender yourself to me and
my men, or face the blade," said a young boy stepping forward. "I see,
a great honor this is, Kurgen, Bringer of Peace, Servant of Dycrus, Wielder
of the Green Gladius, Ravan-bane [Kurgen's favorite part of his title,
not every man has defeated an incarnated version of the Unraveller], and
of course Servant of the Old gods," said Kurgen confiedently standing and
bowing low. "I know of your supposed feats of valor, but now taste the
iron of the future king," said the boy just as confidently, after all ten
of his best guards were behind him. After hearing this they charged, two
were immediately knocked down as Kurgen swiftly kicked their unarmed groins.
"Guess your men are male," chuckled Kurgen dodging an overly wide swing.
He grabbed the arm of the one guard and twisted it, throwing the man's
body into the side wall. The next one he twisted the arm again, pulling
the sword free. Using the quick reflexes of a Warlord always watching his
back for a dagger, he turned his hips and parried a blow swinging it out
wide. Without his defenses Kurgen's quick slash across the stomach ended
his fighting spirit. Without another thought he sent his sword through
the chest of two other guards. The rest just ran away from the invincible
man. "I will finish you then!" yelled the boy charging forward. A blunt
blow to the head stopped him. "See, I wasn't going to let you fight alone,"
laughed the old man carrying his green quarterstave[similair to Kurgen's
gladius, it to could transform to any weapon]. "Why did you leave him alive?"
questioned Kurgen seriously. "I wouldn't want to kill your new student,
now would I," the man laughed at Kurgen. "But..." he couldn't finish the
sentence as the fimilair feeling overcame him. He was turning to sand,
to have the wind carry him, but where?</font>
