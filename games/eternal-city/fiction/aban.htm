<h2 align="center">Aban's Tale</h2>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Aban<br>
<br>
Me head crashed against da wall nearly crackin me noggin right open, but dang did it cause
me to wake up in a hurry. I had no clue where I was. Last thing I recalled was finally
after months of travel arriving in Iridine, da place dey call da Eternal City. It was late
and I was walkin along da docks hoping to find somewhere I could crash fer da night. I
didn't have no money fer one of dem fancy schmancy rooms I see folks renting but I
figgered what da heck, it shouldn't be no problem wit crashin in an alley or some such. I
couldn't have been more wrong!! First thing I heard was a bunch of folks runnin in da
darkness, den I heard someone shout right befer I felt a sharp shootin pain in da back of
me skull. I bet I could have felt da blood trickle down my neck if it hadn't knocked me
plum unconscious. Den I wake up to me head crackin against da blasted wall. I woulda given
me right arm at dat momment fer one of dem Apothocary folks to whip me up sumtin fer a
headache. But as bad as da headache was I felt a heap worse when I realize dat I was
chained to dat dere wall and it wasn't just any old wall, I was in da cargo hold of a
slaver ship. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now growin up in Windward, I always heard da tales of da times when da
entire island was held and da whole populas were slaves. But ever since da last war
between Tuchea and da Republic, Windward had been free and I sure as heck never figgered
I'd end up as a slave myself. But sure as Ereal makes da sun rise in da morn here I was a
slave. Da cargo hold we was in reeked of every imaginable smell a man or woman can
produce. All around me dere were folks in da same prediciment as me. From da looks of dem
all dey came from all walks of life, from every civilized nation, it really don't matter
where ya come from when ya find yerself captured as a slave. Da ship travelled fer what I
figger had to be least a week. As I came to learn it was dem blasted Cinerans. Anyhow, dat
ship travelled on and on. Damn slavers barely fed us and it seemed da only way dey found
to pass da time was to torture us and beat us senseless. Now being a stubborn bloke, I
kept tryin to rip dem chains right out of da wall, so I could get me hands around one of
dem slavers throats, but dem Cinerans know dere slaving. Dey had us in some mighty good
chains. And da more I fought da more often dey would give me a boot to da head. To make
matters worse dere was dis lad chained right next to me by da name of Bennett. Oh good ole
Bennett.... I tell ya dese days I love da lad like a brother but back den he was drivin me
nuts. Well come to think of it, he still drives me nuts, but he's a good fellar
nonetheless. Anyhow, he just kept whinin and snivilin. Beggin dem slavors to let him go
free....ain't no way I was gonna beg fer nutin, I got me pride. But ole Bennett would just
wail and whine all da time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I think all of us figgered dat bout our only options would be to wind up
servin dem Cinerans or we would wind up dead. However, fer whatever reason fate smiled
upon us. Or maybe it was playin a cruel joke on us, even to dis day I'm not sure. Ya see
one monster of a storm was beginin to rage outside. Da boat was tossin and turning all
over da place. And dem Cinerans who had been so brave in beatin and torturin us were
runnin around like a bunch of scared chickens when da fox is approachin. Dey might know
dere slavin, but at least dis group didn't know dere sailin. Because suddenly, we heard a
loud crash, seems da ship had hit a reef and was takin on water. Da captain of dat ship
was runnin through da cargo hold screamin like a mad man. Guess he was seein his profits
sinkin befer his eyes. Bennett was holarin to be let loose, but da captain wouldn't
listen. Den me and a few others started yellin dat we would help him bail da water out of
da ship. Well now dis captain sure as heck wasn't da brightest fellar in da world because
you could just see it in his eyes dat he loved dat idear as he unlocked da first folks. It
weren't long until dat ole captain had his very own fightin dirk stuck in his gut and da
keys were being passed around tryin to free all da slaves as da water rushed in. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Me, I went rushin up da stairs tryin to figger out where we was. I came
across what I figger was da captains quarters, unfortunately standin in dem quarters was
da first mate. Now why da heck dat lad would be standing in dat cabin made no sense to me
at da time but I was more concerned wit not gettin skewered by his fightin dirk den why he
was dere. I leaped to da right as he attacked, dat dirk just missin me by inches.Now it
would have just been a matter of time till he got me if fate hadn't smiled on me a second
time. As I lept out of da way I sorta tripped and landed right near da captains bunk. And
low and behold sittin in a sheathe right under da bunk was a gladius. Now I had never been
in a combat in me life. I'm a farmer, and ya don't get involved in much more combat dan an
occasional bar brawl. But I tell ya, I grabbed onto dat gladius fer everything I was worth
and dat dere mate and I started going at it. We had been fightin fer a few minutes when
Bennett comes rushin into da room. He sees dat I'm doing just fine and den spys da
captains sea chest. Well he heads fer it and starts tryin to open da blasted thing wit a
fightin dirk he must have picked up along da way. Well dat first mate sees dis and goes
into a frenzy. Whatever was in dere must have been mighty important and da reason he was
in da cabin. He lunges fer Bennett. I lept too, tryin to knock Bennett out of da way. Well
I succeeded allright but dat fightin dirk sunk deep into me right arm as Bennett rolled
out of da way. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Course I knew, me life was over if I dropped me weapon, so despite da
pain I lunged back and I guess dat mate didn't expect me to be able to do dat, cause I
caught him by surprise as I was able to nail him solid like in da gut. He fell to da
floor, his life at an end. Was da first time I ever killed someone, and don't let dem
warriors kid ya, it ain't a pleasant thing. Course ya do what ya gotta do in life and to
dis day da only way I know how to fight is to da death. But anyhow, at dat point Bennett
grabbed up da contents of da captains sea chest and we went rushin outside. Just as I
stepped outside the cabin I saw a rather important lookin young lad chargin up some
stairs. Ya could just tell he was of some importance to da Cinerans, I figgerd a diplomat
or sumtin so I went chargin up after him. He turned as he heard me. Den we locked gazes,
real tight like, da kind of gaze ya don't ferget. I thought fer a minute he would come
chargin at me, but he said simply &quot;I will get you for this someday.&quot; Wit dat he
lept over da side of da boat. I prolly would have gone after him if a big ole wave hadn't
knocked me off me feet and into da oceans in da opposite direction. Eventually me and many
others washed up on da shores of what seemed to be a deserted island. Of course even more
drowned on dat ship still chained to da walls. Not sure I'll ever quite fergive dem
Cinerans fer those folks dat never even had a chance. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now den, when we washed up on da shore, dat storm was still ragin on and
dere was utter confusion. Everyone scramblin around tryin to find shelter but at da same
time expectin a Cineran to pop out from behind every tree. Its amazin we didn't all
collapse under da tension. After what seemed like hours we managed to find us a cave near
da beach where we was able to rest until da storm let up a might. While dere, Bennett
began to go through da contents of da sea chest he had managed to get. Had a bunch of
personal stuff, jewelry, some food, pretty much da usual ya would expect. But it also
contained three very important letters dat explained who da important lookin Cineran dat
had jumped overboard was and told us a bit bout what was going on. It seems dat da
Cinerans had a regular full scale slavin operation going on at dis island and it was
headed by a Warlord named of Sacathos. And da lad I had seen was none other dan his son
Orien. Accordin to da letters, Sacathos had been doing a really great job at breakin
slaves wills befer sendin dem back to Cinera. However, also seemed to be a bit of intrigue
going on in da courst of Cinera. Da King had written him comending him of his job but
callin him back to Cinera cause his house had failed to make da necessary tributes. Da
King said in da letter dat he was sure it was his wifes doing and he simply wanted
Sacathos to come back fer a time to put his house in order. Now dere was also a letter
from his wife tellin him not to come back fer she feared what would happen to him. Lots of
silly court type intrigue if ya ask me. And at dis point it really didn't matter a whole
heap to us, all dat mattered was at dis point we realized dat da Cinerans had been doing
da unthinkable, dey had been kidnapping Iridine citizens and turnin dem into slaves, and
dey been doing it fer quite some time.. OH! I almost fergot, one other thing we found
strange at dat time. One of da letters mentioned da troops on da island being fraid of dat
thing dat swims round da island. At da time we didn't think a whole lot about it, but we
eventually figgered it out, and boy what a shock dat was. But I'm gettin ahead of meself. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Soon as da rain lightened we began scoutin da area. Me, I ran into more
dan I bargained fer. Found me a Cineran, but he weren't just a warrior or some such, he
was a Cineran diplomat. Can't say dat I ever really known a diplomat befer but dis fellar
reminded me of a used chariot salesman. Lots of fast talk tryin to save his hide. Another
fellar from our group name of Myrdhyn showed up shortly dere after and we tried to get him
to give us some information but didn't have much luck. So we decided to haul his butt back
to da cave dat we had camp at. Well we got him dere and it weren't long befer folks had
him all tied up so he couldn't go no where. Now believe it or not dis twit actually tried
to make a deal wit me. Offered to lead us all safely to da Cineran slave camp and to
arrange fer just me to be set free if I would see dat he stayed alive in da midst of all
da folks in our camp dat wanted to just string him up. Pretty sure he also made dat offer
to a couple others, but I can't say fer sure. But I tell you one ting, no way in hell I
would ever make a deal to betray me friends even if it was to save me own hide. Now fer
one so concerned wit savin his own skin, he sure died like a rat. We had tied him up and a
few of us stayed to keep an eye on him while da others went a scoutin. Well da fool woke
up and actually tried to leap up, I guess to run. Course dem ropes held him tight and when
he got up he tripped right over his own feet, his skull came crashin right down on a rock,
killed him instantly. I think bout da only useful thing dat came outta dat was dat we
learned we was on an uncharted island up near Cineran lands and almost never did boats
pass the island. Ain't no way we was gonna be rescued by chance and ain't no way we was
gonna be able to sail nowhere unless we could get our hands on some sea charts. Course fer
dat matter we'd also need a crew of sailors lest we crash into another reef. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">After dat, fer at least a month we really didn't do much but focus on
survival. Spendin our day figgerin out how to hunt and fish, make torches, make lean-tos.
Ya know all da stuff ya might need to survive and believe me it weren't easy. Couple
warrior folks name of Quintavius and Caessius were real good at surviving and showin us
how to fight. Den dere was dat Myrdhyn fellar, he was one of dem scholarly types, he was
real good at figgerin out stuff. Heck he was even able to show us what type of berries to
eat and what to avoid. Even managed to use some of dem berries to make some crude
medicines. Heck if it weren't fer him, we prolly never would have gotten as far as we did.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Little by little though we began to realize we wasn't alone on dat
island. Occasionally we would spot a bit of smoke comin from da north, but we never could
quite figger out a passage past some rocky bluffs which were also to da north. At one
point we even ran across another man on da island. Strange fellar, he was all covered in
hair and actin like a wild critter, but yet he had a strange glint of intellect in his
eyes. We tried to track him fer awhile to catch up to him, thinkin maybe he could help us,
but he knew some nearby woods and we didn't. So he quickly was able to get lost. Course it
was while wanderin in dem woods dat we came across another discovery dat proved we wasn't
alone. Bennett and I was walkin through da woods tryin to find sumtin dat might help us
get off dat rock when we came across a strange formation of stones. Ya could just tell dat
dey was put dat way by someone, no way dey could just get dat way natural like. Me I
wanted to get dat smart guy Myrdhyn to come take a gander at dem and figger out what dey
do. Course ole Bennett uttered dose famous last words &quot;They is just stones, what harm
can it do!&quot; Wit dat he yanked one of dem outta da formation. Well all da stones
shifted just a tad as he grabbed da smallest one. Now by stones, I don't mean no blasted
pebbles I mean big ole heavy suckers, some of dem boulders. And of course ya could just
tell dat when dey shifted whatever dat formation was intended to do it, it wouldn't do no
more and dere was no way we could ever get dem back in place. Later on we would learn more
bout dat but fer den I just thumped Bennett upside da head and we headed back to camp, me
doing a lot of muttering and cursing and Bennett proudly displaying his new stone. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It was prolly only a couple days after dat, when we came across another
group of ex slaves. But dese ones had been dere fer a might longer dan us and dey was led
by an honest to goodness Iridine Senator! Yes sir, Mister Castor Diamantian of the Iridine
Senate!! A more infuriatin fellar ya never did meet, all high and mighty cause he had some
fancy title back in Iridine. He'd boss ya around constantly, even just to get him sumtin
to eat. Course along wit him was an old one-legged, war veteran named Gaerian. Now dat
fellar could fight, ya could just tell. Even when he was just standing still, he looked
like he could kill ya if he wanted too. Well weren't long befer we all decided to join up
into one large group. Safety in numbers don't ya know. Plus I figgered maybe in a larger
group I could stay away from Bennett, no such luck though. Dang fellar wouldn't give up on
playin wit dat stone. He'd sneak into my lean-to and put it in bed wit me so dat I had to
carry it! Den of course I'd jam it into his hands in da morning. But next thing ya know
he'd have snuck it into my pack or hidden it amongst my supplies. I swear dat stone passed
back and forth between us so many times ya would have thought we'd wear it down from da
friction. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I guess we prolly stuck around wit dat new camp fer another week or so.
We all exchanged stories and da like. But trully, everyones stories had a certain air of
similarity to dem cause dey all ended up back on dat blasted island. .Den one day a
long-boat was spotted approaching da area of Castor's camp. It nearly turned around before
da group was able to hail it. Dey was having troubles gettin in to shore against da
current and all so me being da fool dat I can be sometimes, I grabbed a hold of one end of
a rope dat Myrdhyn had been able to make outta grass and swum my behind out to da boat.
Den we was able to pull dat boat into shore. Once we got it into da beach a beautiful
women dressed in primitive clothing and a few of her companions stepped out of it. Fer a
minute we thought dey was gonna be hostile and a fight was gonna ensue but we eventually
realized dey was friendly. Course we couldn't speak dere language so we had to draw
pictures and gesture a lot. Dey seemed to like it when we drank from a nearby spring wit
dem. After awhile dem island folks figgered we was from da sea. Which I guess in a sense
we was but not quite like dey figgered. Anyhow, she decided to take us back to her
village. Well we was more dan willing to go wit dem figgerin maybe dey would have a way
fer us to get home. A group of us went in dere long-boat, it was quite a trek, clear
across to da other side of da island. Once we got dere, we was able to convince dem
villagers to send more boats back to pick up da rest of our group. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now dis village weren't civilization if ya was from somewhere like
Iridine, but to me it was grand. Was a nice little fishin village and da folks was real
nice to us. Gave us a hut and all sorts of supplies like food and clothing. Da problem was
dat communicatin wit dem was tough since we didn't share a language. In fact, somehow dey
got da impression dat we was gods from da sea. Now dis led to a heap of problems. It's
mighty tough tryin to not only learn dere language but convince dem dat you need dere help
to sail somewhere when dey is busy lookin at ya as a god. Though we did learn dat dey knew
of da Cinerans. Seems dem slavers was on da other side of some swamp and da cullaidens had
some minor blood feuds wit dem. Dey didn't seem to fightened at da time though. At da time
we wasn't sure if it was cause dey figgerd us gods would protect dem or if da slavers had
just been leavin dem alone cause its tough to train slaves dat don't understand ya. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Course eventually dis idear dat we was gods would all change and at da
same time we'd get a pretty dood idear why da Cinerans had avoided da village. One day da
high priestess of da village, a lass name of Saldwyn, came to me and Caessius. Near as I
could figger form what she was sayin was dat she wanted to know if we was ready fer da
ritual. Not knowin exactly what dey wanted, but realizin it seemed important to dem we
agreed. We was led to da top of dis gate dat overlooked a small harbor and told to watch.
Up on a nearby hillside dat overlooked da harbor we saw some folks in robes and hoods
begin to raise dere arms towards da sky and chant. While dey did dat, right in da middle
of da harbor a large object began to rise, it looked like an entire island just sittin out
dere in da water. Then dem robed folks tossed what looked like a live goat into da water.
Wit dat, da thing we figgered to be an island darted to da spot da goat had been tossed.
Ya see dat thing we thought was an island, turned out to be one humongous sea serpent.
Obviously da thing dat swims round da island dat dem Cinerans had been so scared of. And I
tell ya, rightfully so...dat thing was immense and was able to swallow dat goat in one
gulp!!! After dat we was led back down towards da village and told to lay down on da
ground. Dey started sayin a bunch of words dat we didn't know da translation fer but
luckily we realized we was supposed to repeat dem and was able to. Den dey pulled out a
fish and sliced it open lettin da blood drip into me mouth. I tell ya I nearly lost me
lunch right den and dere. After dat Saldwyn seemed happy and asked us sumtin or other.
Alas we didn't have any clue what she was sayin and dat distressed her. She kept insistin
we do sumtin or other but we had no clue what dat was. Finally, she gave up and began
exclaimin dat we was false gods and went runnin back to town. Wit dat one simple action we
was no longer viewed as gods and cullaidens weren't quite sure what to make of us. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Da next couple days was kinda tense around da village. Dem villagers
just wasn't sure dey could trust us and even though a few of us were gettin better at dere
language it was still a big barrier. Den one day a cullaiden woman named Corraine became
screamin and hollarin fer help. Of course, we went to investigate and found her cryin and
weapin. Now she wasn't too keen on us helpin her but we did manage to get it outta her dat
her daughter had wandered off in da woods and she was now nowhere to be be found. So, we
began searchin da surroundin areas hopin to find her. After hours of searchin we was about
to give up when we heard a wildcat in da distance. Carefully we approached and saw dat big
ole cat circlin a young girl who was unconscious, and had obviously been mauled by da cat.
A couple of us lept in figgerin we would surprise dat cat and she would run but nope dat
cat turned and attacked us. However, I was able to keep dat cat at bay while da other
folks got dat girl out of dere and back to da village. Now dat little girl was lucky to
still be alive cause her wounds were real bad, she was dying and Corraine knew it.
However, ole Bennett was wit us. By dis time Bennett had become one amazing healer so he
set out to see what he could do fer her. Well I'm not sure how he did it but he pulled off
a medical miracle and was able to save her life wit what little med supplies we had.
Corraine was utterly estatic. After dat da villagers began to look favorably on us again.
Dey realized we wasn't no gods but dey figgered we was ok folks like dem cause ya see
Corraine was married to Mikas, da fellar dey called Col-Char which we figger is da leader
of da group. So I guess ya save da child of da leader and folks like ya a bit more. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Things were pretty good round dat village fer awhile. We sorta set
ourselves into da village life a bit. Some of us even spent some time helping out doing
things like helpin dem wit dere fishin our helpin to haul stuff to some nearby farms where
da villagers would bring fish and exchange it fer fresh fruits and da like. Castor would
keep bossin us around though, always dreamin up sumtin new fer us to do. But da lad always
seemed to manage to tick me off even more. He was always referin to da cullaidens as
savages and sayin he would bring back da Iridines to &quot;civilize&quot; dem. Well if ya
ask me dey was doing mighty fine on dere own and had a grand culture. Heck da senator and
I would argue fer hours about da fact dat he wanted to come back and essentially ruin da
cullaidens lifestyle. Dese folks had helped to keep us alive and he wanted to repay it by
ruinin dere lives. He even tried to get me to agree wit him once by sayin he was gonna
make me da diplomat to cullaiden. I just laughed!! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now at da same time we was gettin a bit used to village life we would
keep on explorin da surrounding woodlands. If we was ever to get off dat island and stay
safe we had to know our surroundings. Not sure if it was one of our scouts dat caught da
sight of da bandits or if dey just stumbled onto da village. Bennett and I was standin in
da center of town tryin to have a conversation wit Mikas when a real scruffy lookin man
wandered in. He seemed happy to see Bennett and meself and explained dat he and a few
others were ex slaves. We offered him food, we was always willin to help out others.
Course we started to realize he wasn't so friendly when he kept ignorin Mikas, tryin to
order him around and callin him a savage. Well as I told ya, I can't abide folks callin
dem savages, ya see a man is a man, it's his actions in life dat matter, not some money or
title. I tried to explain dat dey wasn't savages, dat dey was nice folks. He just laughed
at dat. Now I think Mikas must have understood da arguement cause he started sayin sumtin
to da fellar. Well now dis set him off, no way he was gonna let what he viewed as a savage
say anythin to him, so he pulled out his weapon, screamed to his comrades to attack and
dey did. Bennett and I did da same and did our dangdest to defend Mikas and da villagers.
Course Mikas didn't need a whole lot of defending, he was a really good warrior in his own
right. Eventually, da bandits proved to be less dan adequate warriors and were quickly
dispatched. Once it was all over we expected da villagers to be grateful but dey started
lookin at us all funny like and sayin a bunch of words we didn't understand while dey
pointed at Mikas. Eventually dey turned to me and started askin a bunch of questions. Once
we was able to figger out what dey was askin we realized dey was askin why we would
blood-feud witout asking Mikas fer permission. Guess in cullaiden ya need permission from
da leader befer ya can fight. Now dis struck me as odd cause we was saving Mikas life, and
I guess I blurted out dat I don't ask nobody fer permission but meself. Wit dat dey
started talkin and pointing again. Den dey all smiled and pointed at me again and started
callin me Col-Char, which is da same title dey gave Mikas. Another simple misunderstanding
and I'm suddenly da leader of our group in da cullaidens eyes. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">About a week later, Bennett and Myrdhyn were out scoutin da area and
finally found sumtin of importance. Now don't get me wrong we had found all sorts of stuff
out dere, some rivers dat we followed, critter dens, some other cullaiden farms dat we
hadn't known about, even a humongous skull dat had been arranged into a shrine, most
likely a skull from one of dem sea serpents. It seemed like we searched every inch of da
nearby forests. Hell, dey used to call me da Wayward Windwarder cause I'd get lost so much
while I was scoutin. But this find dat dem two made was da first sumtin of importance. Way
off to da west dey found a giant monolith. Very strange, but dere it was standin in da
middle of da woods. Though by climbin up it ya could see all around da nearby region. Was
able to spot where da swamp to da north was and sorta give us some bearings of da area.
Knowin approximately where dat swamp was would save our life later on and help us to meet
back up when we got split up. Now Myrdhyn stayed out dere to poke around and prolly see
what sorta useful stuff he could find. He was always dreamin up new things. And Bennett
came back to camp to let us know about what he found. Well I swear Bennett wasn't back in
town more dan a day when all hell broke lose again. A cullaiden man came into town
screamin dat he wanted to Col-Chas wit Bennett. Well it didn't take us long to figger dat
Col-Chas meant blood feud and dere was no way in hell dat Bennett wanted any part of dat.
Well I always say if anyone is gonna kill Bennett it's gonna be me so I tried to step in
to keep Bennetts head attached to his neck. When I did dat, Mikas kinda stepped in too to
quiet da man down and we started to sort out why dis man wanted to kill Bennett. Well ya
see all dis time Bennett and I had still been handin dat stone back and forth. And now we
finally learned a bit about what it was. It seems dis here fellar had created dat series
of stones and it was some sorta very special shrine. Dey kept callin da stone &quot;god
child&quot; and wanting to know why he would take it. Ya could tell by dere temperment dat
it wasn't just like a church or sumtin, dat shrine DID sumtin, or rather it did at one
point. Course I don't know dis fer sure, it's only me opinion. Oh I coulda thumped Bennett
at dat point, just stones indeed!! Hmm come to think of it I think I did thump him at dat
point. Ahh well, in any event it took a lot of arguing and a lot of being stubborn until
finally we got everyone calmed down. Bennett was all set to leave da village and not come
back befer he would fight da man, he really did feel bad about it all. Mercifully though
after everyone calmed down, Bennett apologized profusely and dat smoothed things over a
bit. Cept now we still had dis &quot;god child&quot; and it's not just sumtin ya can leave
layin around. So Gasha, one of da cullaidens, goes and hands it to me. I just sorta stared
at it fer awhile until finally she said dat I was da col-char so I had to guard da blasted
thing!! I had to walk around keepin an eye on a stone for a dang week!! I swear Bennett
was smirkin da entire time!!!! Thankfully though, at da end of dat week da man who had
wanted to fight Bennett came back and took it to apparently repair da shrine. Finally we
had gotten rid of dat stone. Guess ya had to be dere though. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Well after my week wit da stone I decided it was time fer me to get back
to some scoutin so I decided to head out to da monolith where Myrdhyn was. It was quite a
hike but nutin eventful happened. I got out dere and found dat smart guy who was busy
workin on distillin sumtin or other outta plants, I never did understand it all. So we was
talkin and all about what we should do next when we spotted some movement off to da west.
Fearin it might be da cinerans we carefully made our way in dat direction. Dere we spotted
a fellar dat was obviously cullaiden but he was all beat up. Had a foot missing, walked
wit a crutch, had some spots on his face where da skin was all torn off, and damn did he
reek of da swamp. He got one look at us and ran as fast as he could on dat dere crutch. We
thought about givin chase but didn't seem like we should scare da guy anymore dan we
already had, unintentional as it were. So we came up wit another plan whereby we started a
fire and began cookin fish. Well I tell ya dat brough da man back faster dan anyting. Once
we saw him standin a few feet away we was able to little by little entice him over to da
fire where we gave him fish and allowed him to share da warmth of our fire. Ya could just
tell he was a whole lot more at ease now dat he realized we didn't mean him no harm. Now
da thing bout dis fellar is he might be cullaiden but he sure didn't speak like da others.
He made dese little figures out of stones and leaves and stuff. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">But da oddest thing was dese figures made it real easy fer you to
understand what he wanted you to know. I think da first one he did was of him expressing
gratitude to Myrdhyn and I. We &quot;talked&quot; fer awhile if ya can call it talking.
Him askin about us (he realized right off we didn't belong here) and us tryin to learn
about him. His name was Rabb....Rabb the maker. I liked him a lot, he just had a sorta
gentleness about him. From him we learned a lot of stuff. It seems dat da monolith was fer
dat sea serpent, it apparently was to sprout wings someday and fly into da heavens to join
its mate, da cullaidens worshiped it. Quite an odd situation really. We also learned dat
da cullaidens did not cross through da swamp except fer very special religous
circumstances, plus it was apparently a VERY dangerous place. Apparently da only cullaiden
who really went dere much was Rabb, cause according to him he could smell da quicksand
where others couldn't. We begged him to lead us to da swamp at dat point but all he would
do was take us up to da top of da monolith and point out where it was, tellin us it was
dangerous. Told us it was too late to go through da swamp. Guess it was da truth since da
sun was just about set by dis point. However, we had found us a friend who hopefully would
help us through da swamp in da future. Da followin morning both Myrdhyn and I headed back
to camp in da village to let dem know what we had learned. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I guess it was only a matter of time until da Cineran forces found us,
we were naive to think dey wasn't swarmin all over da island and even a sea serpent can't
keep dem away forever. So eventually da day came when dey came. And boy oh boy did dey
come. Swarmin down on da Cullaiden village, burnin everyting in dere way. Dey lay waste to
da entire place. Such kind givin folks didn't deserve dat. Of course we all tried to
fight, but a fellar has to know when to fight and when to run. Dis weren't da time to
fight, it was da time to run. Our group along wit da cullaidens high tailed it into da
woods and scattered in every direction. Thankfully, most of us were able to regroup out in
da woods while da Cinerans scoured da smolderin remnants of da village and began
organizing patrols to look fer us. I'd love to tell ya us and da Cullaidens formed a nice
unified force and counter attacked but it weren't to be. Da Cullaidens blamed us fer
bringin dis disaster down on dem, guess ya really can't blame dem. Dey was hollain and
screamin up a storm. We was able to pick up parts of what dey was saying, but I tell ya
none of it was good. Wasn't much of a choice, we had to leave dem. So not really sure
where to go we decided it would be best to head back west towards da Monolith dat had been
discovered earlier. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The trip to da west took days and was mostly uneventful. Lots of movin
at night and doing our best to make sure we didn't leave a trail dat da Cinerans could
find us wit. Pretty much moving as fast as we could, not sure why we felt like we'd be
safe at da monolith but I guess it gave us a destination and a purpose. Once we finally
got dere and realized we hadn't been tracked we breathed a collective sigh of relief. Set
us up camp and began lickin our wounds and reestablishin supplies. Course we now had da
realization dat we had to figger out what to do, we couldn't just focus on. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">So, we began sendin out patrols around da area dat kept an eye out fer
Cinerans and more importantly hoped to find anytin useful while da rest of da folks would
be back at camp preparin fer da inevitable conflicts which would follow. Knowin dat da
slavers camp and da swamp was to da north we figgered dat we would head dat way. Last
thing dey would expect is fer us to come right at dem and no way dey would expect us to
cross through a swamp. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Alas, we stayed at the monolith makin preperations a might too long as
dey found us before we were ready for dem. We got word from Gaerian who had been scoutin
da area dat about 12 Cinerans were headed this way and would be here within da half hour.
We made da decision dat a group of us would attempt to ambush dem and if nothing else slow
dem down. While we did dat Bennett would head towards da north wit da non warriors, da
sick, and da injured. It would be up to dem to see that Iridine learned of what happened
if we failed in our assault on da Cinerans. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Our warrior group lay in wait near our camp, hoping to surprise da
Cinerans. In dat we were successful. However da leader of da Cinerans soon managed to
rally his men and da battle became heated. He was a nasty bloke too, stood on an edge of a
ridge nailing us wit crossbow bolts while his men kept us from gettin away and pinned us
in. To dis day I recall him. His name was Philipu and he managed to see dat quite a few of
our men fell. Course we was also able to kill da majority of da vile slavers but our
outnumbered warriors soon began feeling da effects of dere injuries and fatigue. We fought
on but it soon became obvious that da remaining cinerans who had stayed out of da melee
and were fresh could take our injured group. I sounded da retreat and our group scattered
hoping to find a camp towards da north that we prayed Bennett had been able to establish.
Unfortunately Quintavius lay near death in our camp and I spotted him barely breathing. So
I went rushin in and managed to slay a cineran right befer he would have done Quint in.
Unfortunately my great rescue turned bad as I felt dat crossbow bolt in my back and I
slumped to da ground. If it had not been for Senator Castor da two of us would have been
recaptured. Out of nowhere he came chargin in waving a gladius around tryin to fight da
slavers. However his reward for his heroics was dat he was slain in battle. Fortunately,
it did give us da time we needed to recover to crawl into da trees. Fer someone who had
been so arrogant, it was a trully selfless act dat I'll never ferget. Eventually, all of
our group was able to meet up far to da north along da edge of a swamp (whose location we
was able to learn thanks to climbin dat monolith) where we found Bennett waiting with
fresh cooked kidneys fer everyone and plenty of fresh bandages. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We stayed along da edge of da swamp for a few days, venturing into da
swamp every so often and all to often finding it was not very hospitale. Mercifully we had
run into Rabb again who showed us a few tricks that we hoped would allow us to survive in
da swamp since our back was to da wall. It was either face da Cinerans to da south (da few
we hadn't killed would no doubt have reinforements on da way) or da swamp to da north. We
had counted on Rabb showing us da way through da swamp but dis lad in our group named Ace
made a bit of a mistake and scared Rabb off and Rabb went running into da swamp towards da
North East. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We were now back on our own witout someone who knew dis region. However
we ran into another acquaintance, da man we knew as da hairy man dat we had tried to track
so long ago. Dis time he spoke to us though and said he was King Darius and wanted us to
take him with us off this island. He seemed a bit loony but he was strong and more dan
willing to help us out. So myself, and a few others with da hairy guy headed into da swamp
to da NE to hopefully find Rabb. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We travelled fer at least a day and a half, stumbling, falling in
quicksand, and generally having a miserable time of it. Finally we spotted something in da
swamp. Turns out it was an ancient abandoned temple. We never did quite figger out if it
was of Cullaiden origins or not. At da time we began to explore it and found it filled
with traps, gators and was pretty much inhospitable. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Da decision was made dat it probably wasn't a safe place fer such a
small group to hang out at but it was also da only place we knew of to move our main camp
to. So we travelled back to our camp to get da others and move our camp yet again. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">We made it back to our swamp edge camp, and none too soon as Cineran
scouts had been spotted nearby. So we gathered what we could and begain da long trip back
to da temple. Again it took well over a day but once there we felt it was safer with our
numbers to begin exploration. We scoured da place top to bottom and eventually found a
hidden staircase to da second floor. Dare we found entirely too many locked doors. But
after quite awhile of searching we found a door that wasn't locked and in it was an Altene
Mercenary named Galiod who had managed to escape from da slavers main camp quite some time
ago. He was not well, his leg was badly injured and he seemed slightly feverish, or
perhaps mad we really aren't sure. However he told us his tale of escape, his desire to
kill da Warlord Sacathos and most importantly dat he could make us a map to da camp and of
da surrounding region. It seemed too good to be true. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">He required rest first so our doctors did what day could for him and we
went back to make sure our camp here at da temple was secure. Meanwhile Myrdhyn and I set
out to open those locked doors. Frankly I thought for sure he would find a way pick dem
but he came up with a tried and and true method...Break em' down!!! Who was I to argue
with him. Alas after countless hours of bustin open doors all we had was bruised shoulders
to show fer it. So we set up sentrys fer da night and we all tried to get some sleep. We
camped at da temple for a few days while we tended to Galiod. Our food and water was
diminishing and da swamp held little to sustain a group this size. A small group led by
Ace had ventured into da swamp towards da north hoping to find da end of it but was forced
to return due to lack of supplies and da hazards of da swamp. Though we did get some
valuable information bout da surrounding areas from his expedition. In any event, we
decided it was time to try and get Galiod to draw us da map. Alas we found him highly
feverish and disoriented. Our doctors begain discussing what to do to help him out. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">While dey were talking, we felt someting almost like an earthquake which
rocked da temple. Bennett went charging off towards da first floor to see what it was.
Knowing dat Bennett will get himself killed if you leave him alone I went charging off
after him. We went down to da flooded basement where we found an odd statue that we did
not see before. It was slightly tilted and we were able to push it over revealing a hole.
We quickly gathered da rest of da group and ventured down into it. There we discovered a
series of chambers that led to a statue room. Two statues stood there with odd depressions
on da floor. Unable to move dem with our brute strength approach we began searching about.
I believe it was Quintavius who found da first disk in some mud. The disk fit one of da
depressions. When it was put in depression a secret door was opened to another passage. Da
passage ended in an odd room filled with strange runes and da like. Dare was also another
depression so we quickly went back and began trying to find more disks. Soon we had a
bunch of them. We placed a disk in this depression and da room immediately bathed us in
soft light and we felt our wounds all healed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Well damn if we hadn't found a healing room. We'll least thats what we
figured it was. Everyone immediately thought of Galiod so I went back to carry him down.
We brought him down and stuck another disk in da depression. Well that light bathed us
again and den if we didn't all feel great again. We looked at Galiod expecting him to be
well and able to assist us but to our shock he was DEAD! For some reason this light which
healed us all had killed him. We talked about it for some time but coming to no conclusion
picked up our fallen mate and continued exploring this underground chamber. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Well we found disks which we used to open other secret passages. However
we didn't really find anything else of particular note cept some dead ends. Unless ya
count da first houndsnake we ran into down dere. Big ole trained snake type critters da
cinerans used to track us wit. It was da first we had ever seen but certainly wouldn't be
da last. After da battle though we were all getting mighty tired so we decided to return
to camp and bury Galiod. Den someone suggested we try da room once more and maybe it would
heal him. So we went back. Just as we were about to put da disk in da depression, we
noticed that all of our hair and fingernails were a lot longer. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Its not something we usually think about, I mean we have been on this
blasted island for so long and appearance isn't your main concern but dis was noticeable. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It was den we figured it out, dis room seemed to advance time somehow.
And no I ain't crazy, it really did, was da dangdest thing ya ever seen too!! We were all
healed since dat is what would happen over time. However Galiod was dying and dis advanced
it. Saddened though realizing dis would be good in case of an emergency we returned to
camp. Dare we ate just about all of our remaining supplies. It was as if we hadn't eaten
in days, and maybe we hadn't. Finally Quintavius saw to it that Galiod had a traditional
Altene burial for dere was nothing more we could do fer him. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dat followin mornin we took a gander at our supplies, or I guess I
should say our lack of supplies and it became apparent we had to move on. Fer awhile we
contemplated headin back towards da Cullaidens or maybe going back straight south but we
eventually ruled dat all out. We hadn't had any luck down dere so maybe if we could find
da slavers camp we could sneak on board a boat or some such. So it was back into da swamps
headin due north. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Just like a lot of our journey, wasn't much dat happened but we spent a
lot of days walkin and tryin to stay a live. Eventually we found da end of da swamp and a
area of bramble. It weren't real hospitable either but at least dere was a bit more game
and some solid ground fer a change. Little by little we continued north through da bramble
always bein careful to keep an eye out fer da Cinerans and send small patrols ahead of da
main group. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It was durin one of dem patrols when things turned interesting again. I
was leadin a patrol group and we came across a woodland ridge. Well naturally we began to
explore it, when off in da distance we spotted what looked like a fort and den suddenly we
heard voices headin our way. I signalled fer folks to douse dere torches and hide behind
some trees. Me I headed on a bit ahead tryin to get a gander at who was up ahead. Now I
tell ya, I screwed up royally here. Guess I misjudged how far da voices was cause I ended
up stumblin right into da midst of about 12 Cinerans soldiers. Didn't take more dan a few
seconds till I was surrounded and forced to lay down me gladius. First ting dey asked was
where da others was. I of course told dem dere wern't no others, cause ya see we had made
sumtin clear in da patrol when we ran across Cinerans. If someone got captured by a large
force, we weren't gonna go tryin to play hero, we was gonna go back and get da others to
not only help wit da rescue but so dey didn't get surprised. I mean we was da scout group,
it was our job to warn dem. But one of da folks in me group named Ace must have taken
charge and decided he was gonna be a hero cause just as dey was about to take me back to
dere fort fer questionin I hear him hollarin dat da Cinerans should lay down dere weapons
cause dey is surrounded. Now don't get me wrong what he was doing was brave and all, but
it just weren't bright and it nearly got me killed. Ya see dem slavers tried to get me to
have all my comrades come out of da trees or dey would kill me. All I did was yell in
cullaiden fer dem to run away and get help. But nope dey didn't do dat, ole Ace just a
kept on hollarin and screamin. So da slavers had no choice but to go lookin fer dem. Da
leader was going to kill me since he couldn't just leave me at his back while his force
went off lookin fer da rest of me group. Now as I stared at him pullin out his fightin
dirk fer a second I though I was dead, but den an idear struck me dat. I pulled out dem
letters dat we had gotten from da sea captains chest. I swear his jaw dropped a mile when
he saw a letter bearin da crest of da King of Cinera on it and another bearing da Seal of
da Sacathos house. I started bluffin how I had messages fer da Warlord Sacathos dat had
been given to me by dat diplomat dat had tried to bribe me way back when. Dis seemed to
confuse him a bit. He said if dat was so dat I should submit and let dem tie me up and
take me back to dere fort fer questioning. Well I figgered dat being captured was a whole
lot better dan being dead so I did as he asked. So dere I was tied up in da fort while da
rest of my party apparently was runnin around da woods tryin to avoid da cinerans at da
same time get to where I was to rescue me. From da sounds of it, it wasn't going well. Dey
just had us outnumbered and some of our group weren't warrior types, dey was more
pathfinders. Luckily though, Caessius was wit us and he is a fine warrior, he was able to
dispatch a couple of da enemy dat had split off from da main group. Stupid move on dere
part really, as a single force dey coulda crushed us, all split up we had a chance. In da
meantime I was able to break free of me ropes and suddenly I was free within da fort. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">At dis point I managed to sneak out of da fort and meet back up wit a
few of da original scoutin party. Wasn't much of a force mind ya, just 3 of us, but it was
enough to start pickin off a cineran here and a cineran dere dat had split up so stupidly.
Den we ran across da leader of dat group and we was on him! He let out a call fer his
troops but dey didn't arrive fast enough. A big ole mess of dem showed up just in time to
watch us slay dere captain. We figgered we'd have to retreat at da point but dey saw his
dead corpse and went runnin off into da woods. We gave a bit of a pursuit but we didn't
have da forces to really put up much a fight, guess dey figgered we had more dan we
thought we did. So at dis point we did da only thing we could, we went back to da fort and
claimed it as our own!! But as we arrive a large bird like critter took off from da fort,
we wasn't sure if it was a messenger or what but we figgered it couldn't be good. Warlord
usually ain't too happy when you go and capture dere forts. Alas we also found sumtin else
dat showed our capturin of da fort hadn't come witout a price. Within da compound we found
our comrade Ace in da stockades and his throat had been cut. Apparently da cinerans had
managed to catch up wit da lad after I got away and dey wasn't about to let another of us
folks get away. Unfortunately dere wern't much we could do fer him but see dat he got a
proper burial da same we did wit those who fell befer him and would fall after him. A
couple folks went back to get da main group while da rest of us ransacked da fort fer
supplies and tried to relax in our new fort. Some of us even mangaged to get our hands on
some basic armor, we was startin to turn into real warriors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Once da main group caught back up wit us it had pretty much already been
decided dat we had to move on. No way we could stay when dere was no doubt a bunch of
soldiers on da way. So we moved on again, but from dis point on, moving was a whole lot
more eventful. Dere were patrols wit houndsnakes all over da place. We would take some
out, run from others, it sure weren't easy. Maybe it was da stress from all da patrols or
maybe it was all da new ex slaves dat we began to locate who were hiding, half starved
around da island but a lot of folks started to get on edge. A lot of fightin and arugin
amongst us all started to occur. Though Quintavius and I did our best to keep takin charge
cause da only way we was gonna get off dat rock was to work together. It was after
travellin ever so slowly to da north fer a few days dat I decided we needed some serious
scoutin done. Sendin out small parties just wasn't workin cause da patrols would catch
dem. So I set out on me own to scout out da area. Now I travelled fer days and days, as
just one person I was easily able to avoid da patrols and move quickly. Eventually I found
da northern edge of da island and some rocky bluffs. But me luck at avoid da patrols
didn't last. I ran into what I thought was a long warrior so I dispatched him. But his
scream caused a couple more wit houndsnakes to show up. I started runnin to da trees,
figgerin I could elude dem easy, but sumtin else happened. I heard a horn off in da
distance, I was close the the Cineran main camp!! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now at da same time I was doing me scoutin and sendin info back via a
code dat dis fellar named Dytan and I had worked out Quintavius was continuin leadin da
folks north. Dey had a few interestin adventures on da journey. Dey found a big ole tower
dat was occupied by a small group of Cinerans. Maybe dey was using it as a base camp fer
patrols not really sure. Well our guys surprised da hell out of dem because it weren't
long before dat tower was ours just like da fort befer it had been. It was also round dis
time when dey managed to capture us a cineran to try and get some information from him. Da
problem was dis bloke dey captured weren't a cineran, he was Altene. Seems da Cinerans had
hired some Altene mercs and as anyone knows ya don't want to mess wit a heap of Altene
mercs so dis sorta worried us. I think dey eventually killed him but beferhand dey learned
dat we was startin to really tick of Sacathos wit out assault and run tactics as we
slipped through his grasp. Our group was just small enough to hide but large enough to
make some troubles fer his patrols who were more used to war dan sneak attacks. Dey also
got some information from dis lad about da location of da slavers camp and da number of
folks dere. Well dat information was passed on to me and I began scoutin in da area he
said. I scouted fer a good 3 days while dey held position at da tower, eventually we came
to da realization we had been duped, it weren't anywhere near. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">So I passed word back and I guess dat was when dey decided to move out
again while I headed back in da opposite direction hopin to find da slavers camp. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">At dis point, dey was travellin in da woods when someone better dan us
at movin in stealth caught up wit dem. It was our old friend Rabb. It seems dat part of da
reason Sacathos couldn't turn his full attention on us was dat we weren't da only ones
attackin him. It seems da Cullaidens had decided to blood feud wit da Cinerans and were
also somewhere up here to da north fightin in small groups. However, Rabb needed everyones
help, he had found a farm wit a bunch of Cinerans where slaves both cullaiden and from da
mainlands were being held. Well me friends figgerd dey had to help so dey let Rabb led dem
to da farm. Dere dey pulled another sneak attack. Dis time though dey almost got dere
butts whooped. Da battle didn't go well fer awhile, dey even had to pull a retreat.
However eventually dey was able to turn da tide and take da farm freein da slaves. Like
always dem Cinerans dogs ran as soon as things looked bad fer dem. Now bout da same time
dat I saw da signal dat dey had taken da farm I finally found da slavers main camp. It was
HUGE!!! Fencing was more dan a mile and a half long, covered in archers. Da fort could
easily hold 50 soldiers, not to mention da slaves who dey was obviously holding dere. It
was also situated in such a way dat a mini bay jetted into it so dat any boat dat might
come to da island could sail safely into da fort. I did as much recon of da area as I
could witout gettin caught and den headed towards da farm to catch up wit everyone and
pass on me recon. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It was good to get back to da main group and see dat everyone was still
well. I passed on all da information dat I had learned from seein da Cinerans Fort. Now,
wit each victory we was becomin just a bit more bold. But we realized if we ever came
across a big force and got pinned we was in trouble. A few of da slaves we had rescued at
da farm joined us so our group got a bit bigger. We had lots of idears at dis point, we
thought about hauling a bunch of spears and tryin to sneak into da fort to get da slaves
held dere to revolt. We thought about tryin to get da cullaidens to help us build some
longboats and ambush a supply ship befer it ever got to da fort. To be honest, we had been
dong a lot of flying ba da seat of our pants instead of having a concrete plan. But when
yer in dis kinda battle, ya don't have organized plans, ya use what presents itself. It
was at dis point while we were tryin to figger out what to do dat we found us a nasty
thief in da woods. He snuck in and out of dat farm stealin stuff so fast I swear he coulda
been invisible. We split up all over da place hopin to catch him, and eventually he
slipped up and we got him. It seems he was a thief from one of da poorer parts of Iridine
and he didn't trust us at all. A real dispicable fellar who would take anytin dat weren't
nailed down and blamed us fer his problems. Wouldn't even admit he was a thief. Finally
though after a heap of arguements, he admitted what he did and returned da stuff he even
apologized grudgingly because it was about da only way I was gonna even talk wit him. I
can't abide folks who have no honor. Its one ting to be a thief, another thing to lie
about it. If ya think its ok to take stuff, which mind ya I don't, least ya can do is be a
man about it and admit it. Well after all dat arguin we started talkin wit him. He finally
came to realize we wasn't da Iridine Police or anyting and he made us a offer. He was
willing to sneak us into da slavers main camp and in return we would create a distraction
fer him while he stole da Warlords treasure. We would den fight our way to a ship and sail
back to Iridine. We den had to give him an hour or so head start once back in Iridine. Me,
I had never heard a more ridculous idear. It's one thing to try and break into a big ole
fort, its quite another to waste yer energy and risk yer neck over a heap of cash! Dead
men can't use money, and ya can't take it wit ya. Too much greed if ya ask me. Me and a
few others dat had some common sense quickly told dat thief what he could do wit dat
idear. But we did learn sumtin we thought maybe we could use. Dere was a underground
passage into da fort dat da houndsnakes used as a den. However in late afternoon dem
houndsnakes was asleep. I personally thought sneakin in through a houndsnake den was a
sure way to die but some folks in da group thought it might work. Guess we spent a couple
day arguin after dat about what to do. A lot of folks went off scoutin around hopin to
find sumtin to aid us. Was a lad named Unger dat did a heap of scoutin and got some real
good recon of da area. He and a few others eventually decided to head up towards da
slavers main camp. Was about 12 or so of dem while a bunch of us remained back at da farm.
Not sure what exactly dey figgered dey was gonna accomplish, maybe just get some more
recon but dey managed to pull of a bloody miracle!! </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dey eventually got to da camp and I have no clue what dey was thinking
but a lad named Levine and Unger led a group figgerin dey could sneak in. Well dat didn't
work at all and dey had to retreat. Levine even tried to lead a bit of an assault and
he'll tell ya straight he screwed up. And it was bad, da majority of dat group got
captured. Wasn't a good situation, da rest of us didn't even know dey were captured.
However good luck was startin to smile on us again. Fer Sacathos' head lackey slave named
Selaric helped dem to escape and get out of da fort. Dey was free once more. Boy oh boy I
would have liked to see Sacathos' face. He finally had some of us and dey got away. At dis
point dey headed to da north searchin some nearby plains. After a few hours dey saw some
activity to da south back where da slavers fort was so dey headed back. Well when dey got
dere it looked like da place wasn't quite as occupied as it had been. Wit dem dey had dis
lad named Slyce, a whiz wit a lockpick. Not sure I really want to know why he was so good
but he was able to sneak up to da fort and pick da front gate witout anyone even spyin
him!! Wit dat our forces went rushin in. Dey met some resistance in da outter keep but it
sure wan't heavy and dey started makin quick work of dem all. I weren't dere or nutin but
accordin to da tales Levine and Patch were like wildmen killin more dan dere fair share of
Cinerans in da assault. Fer ya see da Cinerans were out on patrol and dere were only light
forces left back at da camp. It weren't long befer dey had taken da entire camp!! Dey had
pulled off da amazing and taken da fort right under da warlords nose. Talk about right
place at da right time!! Dere was even a few reports of da warlord himself fightin in da
combat but nutin confirmed and nobody knew at dat point where he had run off to. And so
long as da Warlod and his main force was out dere we was hardly safe. Some even thought he
might have gotten away by boat. And if dat was da case we was trapped and soon da Warlord
would be back wit many many more warriors. </font></p>
