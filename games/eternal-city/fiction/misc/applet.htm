<h1 align="center">Appolus, Letters From the Service</h1>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">written by Appolus<br>
<br>
To Appolus from Apigreth:<br>
<br>
Appolus, I need the support of your unit, My left flank was overrun by the Sosteran
hordes, and I need more men to bolster it. If your men don't come, I'll be forced to
retreat from the pass, leaving your flank open to attack. Although the eastern from is
doing badly, we pushed the Sosterans back onto the bluff this morning and captured them on
the West. Unfortunately, my troops are running out of supplies and I had to send a
detachment for food and bandages. Send your soldiers as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
To Apigreth from Appolus:<br>
<br>
I received your request and sent a battalion of pikemen and lancers to hold your flank
from a cavalry or infantry assault. I too have had a diminishing supply of rations and had
a party sent to get some form the nearby villages. My men are being driven closer to your
position, and I fear we may be pushed together and surrounded. I want you to give up the
pass tomorrow and set your defenses up near the encampment in D'thar, I will hope to see
you there, my friend. May Ereal bless us. I must go back to my troops.<br>
<br>
To Appolus from Apigreth:<br>
<br>
your company reached me, but it seems they were attacked on the way, for there were
wounded in their midst. One of my scouting parties returned and informed me that another
army of Sosterans is coming around behind us. I am withdrawing into the valley to wait for
your legion. Expect an attack in the early hours of dawn, because the new group cannot
skirt around you, they will try to drive you back to where they can roll up on your flank.
I hope my letter reaches you soon enough that you may brace for the assault.<br>
<br>
To Appolus from Apigreth:<br>
<br>
I have been caught between to Sosteran forces and I cannot withdraw farther. Already today
I have lost a regiment of cavalry, and your pikemen have not reported in, I fear the
worst. The attack came in the night and we were ill prepared. I need you to swing north
and trap the larger force. I have managed to hold the valley thus far, but the enemy
arrows are taking a tremendous tole on my men.<br>
<br>
To Apigreth from Appolus:<br>
<br>
I have received your message and swept around the Sosteran forces, attempting to distract
them long enough for you to retreat. I have received news of reinforcements for our units
from the West. Ereal willing, we will be able to surround the Sosterans and destroy them.
Until then I am marching my men at full pace towards your position.<br>
<br>
To Appolus from the 3rd cavalry division under commander Hindthe:<br>
<br>
Greetings commander, and my highest thanks to you for managing to hold as long as you
have. Before dawn I intercepted your messenger. I am marching at this moment Southwards,
trying to help rout the Sosterans, my men shall be in position this evening, I propose an
assault this night, while the Sosteran troops are asleep. Until then, I bid you good
hunting.<br>
<br>
To commander Hindthe from Appolus:<br>
<br>
I am glad to receive your news, my assault will commence in an hour, after night falls, I
hope to take the enemy archer emplacements on the ridge before I take the valley, to
reduce our casualties. My cavalry shall lead the way, supported by lancers and swordsmen.
My men will issue forth a battlecry, and that should be your cue to begin your assault. I
want your men to form somewhat of a &quot;gate&quot; that shall roll up their flanks and
slice through them, freeing Apigreth's men. My footmen shall provide a method of your
withdrawal before we mop up the remaining Sosterans.<br>
<br>
To Appolus from commander Hindthe:<br>
<br>
It sounds good, my attack force is now ready, awaiting your command.<br>
<br>
To commander Hindthe from Appolus:<br>
<br>
The attack was a complete success, my men have counted over 10,000 Sosteran soldiers
captured, another 15,000 dead. I appreciate your help when I was overrun, you saved my
life. I regret I won't be able to congratulate you in person, for I am bed ridden due to
an arrow through the stomach. My units lost 5,000 men during the entire campaign. I expect
your casualty report, and a full report on how Apigreth's men fare. <br>
<br>
To Appolus from commander Hindthe:<br>
<br>
I lost 2,000 in the battle, and Apigreth lost nearly all of his 10,000 in combat. He
himself is unconscious at this moment. But he will soon wake. I will give further report
when we reach D'thar.<br>
