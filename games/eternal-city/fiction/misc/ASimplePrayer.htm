<h1>A Simple Prayer</h1>

Thank you Ereal. Thank you for your blessings, and many gifts. Thank you for the strength
to live each day. For my life I give the greatest thanks. Even though you are not here, we
can see you. Even though you do not speak, we can hear your whispers. Even though it is
dark, we can see your life. Thank you. </font></p>
