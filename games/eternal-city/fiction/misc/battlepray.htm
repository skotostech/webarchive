<h1>Idyan Battle Prayer</h1>

<p><font size="2"><b>Ancient Idyan Battle prayer, 4th Archer Company, Iris&#146; legion. <i>(Recorded
by Nysus the scribe before the battle of Cresis) </i>326 years before the founding of
Iridine, 17th day of Iris. </b><br>
<br>
May Ereal grant us with his blessings for our coming battle, Give us the hands of stone,
with which we can fire our mighty bows. <br>
Give us the eyes of the hawk, so that we can smite our enemies from a distance. <br>
Give us the legs of the Cheetah, so that we may run and live To fight another day.<br>
Please Ereal, we don&#146;t want to die. <br>
May we engage the opposite Direction of the enemy with no dishonour to our name. <br>
Please Ereal, we don&#146;t want to die. <br>
May we run faster than the Quickest soldier bearing even the smallest knife So that we may
serve our homelands another day.<br>
In exchange for your blessings, we humbly give you three things, A small rock, a present
from our mother Midlight. <br>
A bronze arrow, cherished by our finest archer And a silver bow, used by the purest of our
warriors. <br>
Thank ye Ereal for granting our humblest demands. <br>
May we serve you With honour as the finest archers on Midlight, fighting in your name.<br>
<br>
<b>(After the battle, the 4th company suffered no casualties and had the highest kill rate
out of the eight archer companies of Iris&#146; legion)</b></font></p>
