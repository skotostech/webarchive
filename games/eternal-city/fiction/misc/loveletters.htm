<br>
To my dearest Moonlite,<br>
My father has become a constable and has found out that your father is a thief. I am to
stay away from you, and never look or speak to you again. I am sickened by the way my
father thinks of you, only because of the way your father is. I&#146;m so sorry. Tonight
at midnight, meet me in the last hall of the Stone Toga Inn. I have a gift for you.<br>
I love you,<br>
Alex<br>
<br>
Dear Moonlite,<br>
I am thinking about running away from home and renting a room in the Stone Toga Inn. My
mother went to Monlon to shop and has never returned. Since then my father has treated me
like a slave and it is a hideous feeling. Do not tell anyone about me running away, I
would be killed. Please visit me in my new room every 3 days, I will tell you what room it
is soon.<br>
Love,<br>
Alex<br>
<br>
Dearest Moonlite,<br>
I have run away and I am in my new room. It is the room at the very end of the hall in the
Stone Toga Inn. Please visit me tonight, I must speak with you. I know the Stone Toga Inn
is far from the Safelands, but it is a safe place to hide.<br>
Your Love,<br>
Alex<br>
<br>
To my Dear one,<br>
Moonlite, my father has moved away to Monlon, looking for my mother. He does not care
about me; he just left a note on the doorstep that he has left me. Oh yes, I suggest that
you keep these notes in a safe place, like your keep sake chest. <br>
I miss you, <br>
Alex<br>
<br>
<i> Hey Alex,<br>
Would you stop being so mushy on my sister? I mean, geez! Gie her a break! Her poor heart
is gonna explode for heavens sake!<br>
Moonlite&#146;s brother,<br>
Herc N. Crashton<br>
<br>
</i> <b> To my dearest Alex,<br>
My brother Herc and Starhead have found your love notes and are making fun of me. What
shall I do? I have found a key for my keep sake chest and I am hiding it under my bed. At
least my sister Sunshine has not found out. That would be terrible. <br>
I love you so much,<br>
Moonlite A. Crashton<br>
<br>
</b> Dearest Moonlite,<br>
Your brother Herc has sent me a note telling me not to be so mushy on you. I hope you are
okay with this. I have left the Stone Toga Inn, for I have spent my last sen. I have no
money left to pay rent. Now I am just a wondering lost soul. <br>
I love you every day,<br>
Alex<br>
<br>
Dear Moonlite,<br>
I believe this will be my last note to you, for I am hiding from the Solders. They are
looking for me because I saw the plan. Moonlite, no matter what happens to me I will love
you and never stop. Do not forget me.<br>
I love you, <br>
Alex<br>
<br>
<i> Dear Moonlite,<br>
Today I was in Monlon and I saw your boyfriend Alex lying on the ground dead. He was
holding an unfinished love note to you, telling you that he was dying. <br>
I&#146;m so sorry,<br>
Herc N. Crashton <br>
