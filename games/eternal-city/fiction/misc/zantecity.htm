<h1>Zante's City</h1>

Sunrise. I sit at the Harbor of Moons, its waters gleaming golden under the soft light of the early sun. I stare peacefully out to
sea as the morning rays caress my skin with their sensual warmth. Behind me my city wakens. 
<br><br>
Many a tale of love and friendship have unfolded here, but not for me as I have never loved or been loved and exist without
friends. Many heroes have risen and fallen in this city, their lives a saga retold and remembered forever. But not I, I will be
forgotten when I die. I know these people not as individuals, but as a whole they are my family. I would fall in battle for these
people, though my life may not seem much to them. Without them I would be even less than I am, but in my absence, their daily
lives would not change. And yet I am content here, sustained by the love and happiness of others, fuelled by their hopes and
dreams, as I have none of my own. I belong here, heart and mind, body and soul. For this is my haven, my city of never-ending
love and life. This is Iridine. This is the Eternal City.
