<p><font size="2">Letters to the front lines- A collection by Cyanicus</font><b></p>

<p><u><i><font size="2">The story of Aerivan and Ophedia</font></i></u></p>

<p><font size="2">Seventh Day of Thyacles, 3<sup>rd</sup> year of Strife (dates
approximate to 27 years before the Republic)</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2">Dear Aerivan,</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I hope the war is going well for the Legion and for Idya. I worry for
your safety and I do wish you could come back to feel my tender lips. Things are well
enough at home. My father was hired by the Inner Council to lead the construction and
maintenance of the weapons workshops while my mother dear is staying home to tend her
child. My responsibilities around the house are tending the sheep and pigs in the pen and
making the morning and noon meals, while my mother makes the evening supper. I love her
mutton stew, which she makes for the family every night. However, I must admit that you
were here to sample her cooking with the whole family. My father really liked you and my
mother was greatly charmed. Even little Enia accepted you into the family.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I must be babbling on for I am running out of ink. I must get another
vial of it right now. I am back, me love and I thought about you when I walked to my
father&#146;s cellar. Oh sorry, I forgot that you are reading this. I must be worried with
love for you since I see you in front of me when I feed the old sows.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Enough about my affairs, I would like to know you are doing? Please tell
me where you are now. So far, I am imagining that you are walking through the marshlands
hunting down the ruthless Cinerans. I can&#146;t believe that they would attack Idya
though. We did nothing to them yet their plans for conquest blinds them from the love they
tear us from. Since I wish to talk to you more, perhaps we could share this short poem
together. I wrote this when I was watching Ereal set last night. When you read this, say
it out loud, and if you look up into the stars while the sun dips below the horizon, you
may see me singing with you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">You are my sunshine, the one who lightens the day,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">You are my flower, who catches the morning dew.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">You are my sunshine, who makes the sky so blue,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">You are my flower, the one who makes me gay.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Whenever I wake while the sky is new,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">I know that I&#146;ll always be with you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">When I look at the stars and hope, that my love</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">We&#146;ll be forever, like the joining of the doves.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">My love to yours, Ophedia</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><b></p>

<p><font size="2">Twelth day of Invex, 3<sup>rd</sup> year of Strife</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2">To my only true love, Ophedia</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Your letter was lovely and I am writing back to you. When I first got
the letter from my friend Jormidia, I was ecstatic that you would write to me. That night,
I read the poem at the stars and I heard your sweet, Finch&#146;s voice resonating
throughout the heavens, like a goddess&#146; song.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">However, I feel that I should write about what I&#146;ve been doing out
here. The war against the Cinerans is going wonderfully. We crushed the Cinerans at the
northern bridge and we captured the Cineran village of Ruenis. I&#146;m currently sitting
in my quarters writing this letter with whatever things I have. I must regret that my
commander gave me little ink and I must end this letter shortly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I killed a Cinner today, although I take no joy in the slaughter of
others. When the soldier was implaled with the tip of my blade, I knew that he was only
defending his homeland, like that of us he had a family and loved ones as well. Enclosed
with this letter is the charm I wear with me always. I wish you to keep it because it will
look splendid on you when our wedding day comes after this war and because the blood from
the battle would only tarnish its pure innocence, the ruby that adorns the charm. I can
only hope that you wear it by your heart always as a reminder of my eternal love for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sadly, I am a terrible writer and an even worse poet, so I will not
torment you with my rhyme. Therefore, I will write you this lullaby that my mother sang to
me when I was little to put you at rest.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">When the sky is at rest and Ereal sleeps,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">I only wonder what is in our dreams,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Is it sunshine, or is it flowers,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Is it the warm, tender smile of your mother?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Could it be the tranquil flapping?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Of gentle lark whom sees us sleeping?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">When the fireflies dance through the night,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Shedding its peaceful blue light</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">My fears go away,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">As the willows do sway</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Like your gentle, light breath</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Which as well puts me at rest.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">When the fireflies dance through the night,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Shedding its peaceful blue light</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">My fears go away,</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">As the willows do sway.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">With concern, your dearest Aerivan</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><b></p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty-sixth day of Invex, 3<sup>rd</sup> year of Strife</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2">My dearest Aerivan,</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I received the terrible news from Legate Draxis. I can&#146;t believe
it, you broke your hip because of a cursed Cineran. When I heard of your injury, I wanted
to kill myself. But when I thought of being with you, my spirits lifted and I dropped my
grandfather&#146;s old Idyan war dagger. I hear that you will never be able to walk again,
other than using crutches. I know what you are going through, and I know how depressed you
must feel to be injured so. However, if it is any comfort to you, I will help you through
every step of the way, and if that doesn&#146;t make your eyes light up, remember that I
still have the necklace you gave me and I look forward to the day we wed. Once you are
sent back into my waiting arms, we will live in our own house, and have a wonderful
family. My parents are also anxious to see your face again and anxious to see us together,
bonded by the head priest of Ereal like the bonding of the sun and the rock that we now
grow from and are nourished by.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">From Ophedia, Our love will live through the ages.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><b></p>

<p><font size="2">Second day of the Festival, 4<sup>th</sup> year of Strife</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2">To my dearest Ophedia,</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I too feel anxiousness towards our joining. It will be a glorious day in
the heavens when our two souls merge as Ereal did when he did so with the rock. My
commander will legally discharge me after a few more days in the hospice. The healers
managed to set my hip bone back slightly, enough for me to limp uneasily with a crutch,
and my pain is gone whenever I move my leg. I was fortunate to give my necklace to you
before my blood ruined it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">By the way, I managed to earn enough praise during my services to Idya
to actually be granted a small home on the edge of the city. The Legate was kind enough to
compliment me on my valiant effort in the battle to the inner council so they rewarded me.
He also knew that I was going to wed you after the war anyway.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">I look forward to return home and sample your mother&#146;s cooking as I
have heard high praise of it in your letter. I also look forward to your gentle and
beautiful face again, as it is a relief for the sore eyes that have witnessed way too much
battle.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dear love, I believe I cannot stop writing about you. My quill flows
like the great river unendingly. However, although my hand is ceaselessly writing, my mind
is as blank as a schoolboy&#146;s slate. I will finish this letter off with a short ballad
that we shall sing together in at the stars, like the poem you wrote me.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">When the wind blows, my heart will flow</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Flow with your gentle soul.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">I see you there, upon a stone</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Waiting, waiting for me</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">When the wind blows, my heart will flow</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Flow as your free soul</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">You wave at me, and I wave back</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">As two lost friends reunited.</font></p>
