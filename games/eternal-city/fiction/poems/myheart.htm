<h1>She Has My Heart</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Laskari Banetet <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">What is it in this Lady that can so posses a man?<br>
Is it in her walk?&nbsp; For she walks with grace, to be sure.<br>
A dancer's grace has she, every step just so.<br>
<br>
What is it in this Lady, that can captivate me so?<br>
Be it in her eyes?&nbsp; Her smile?&nbsp; Hypnotic beyond the crystals of a sorcerer.<br>
As if a Divine Michealangelo did free her from the stone.<br>
<br>
What is it in this Lady, that takes Laskari's heart?<br>
She is like art, like a song, or a poem.<br>
Finely crafted, a work of great grace, and perfect symmetry.<br>
It is as if every line, every curve and joint was the craft of a god, and with his
greatest blessing.&nbsp; She is fair is my love.<br>
<br>
Yet what is the magic?&nbsp; What so captures me? There are fair Ladies aplenty.<br>
This, above all else, is what I must answer.<br>
This is my mystery, my puzzle.<br>
The tumbler of my endless study.<br>
And the answer comes, like love, with warmth and a smile.<br>
<br>
It is her heart, it is her caring, it is the ease with which she smiles.<br>
For it is this, her heart, her soul, that makes her truly a Lady.</font></p>
