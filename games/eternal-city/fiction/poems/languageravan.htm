<h1>The Language of Ravan</h1><p><font size="2">By Anonymous<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

The Language of Ravan<br><br>Is the sword that cuts down a soldier's life.<br>Is the blood that seeps from his skin.<br>Is the darkness that blankets the field<br>in a coldness that keeps the red scarred land within.<br><br>Is the knife a cutthroat wields to slit throats,<br>or free a purse from its strings.<br>Is the end of one thing and the beginning of another.<br>The Language of Ravan speaks of many things.<br><br>Is the wailing cries of a mourning mother.<br>Is the stifled tears of an orphaned child.<br>Is the huddled rocking of a frightened, hidden soldier<br>huddled under corpses of comrades in the wild.<br><br>Is the dirty desperation known in The Steps.<br>Is the political backstabbing found in The Forum.<br>Is in The Temple priests who plot against all<br>who speak any language other than Ereal's.<br><br>Is a deadly tongue: swift, sharp, scathing, cursed.<br>Is a soothing melody <br>bringing release to the suffering, <br>and reward to those who lived well and long.<br><br>Is the language of life and death:<br>it sings and argues, coos and screams.<br>Is not evil and is not to be feared.<br>Is the source and the end of all dreams.<br>
