Worms, Fish, a Moral, and a Happy Ending<br>by Dyana<br><br>I have committed a crime,<br>The most foul crime a person can commit.  <br>I've committed murder and I am committed to it.<br><br>My victim is a worm.<br>Literally.<br>Many, many, many worms,<br>Each one drowned as repeatedly as can be.<br><br>And I had an accomplice.<br>A whole school of them.<br>All of different colors.<br>And, oh, I, uh, killed them.<br><br>It's not like I don't feel guilty.<br>It's not like it isn't pleasant.<br>One wriggles in dirt.<br>The other smells indecent.<br><br>We call it fishing  but it's murder, I say.<br>Call it like it is and make the merchants pay.<br>(I have to make a living somehow<br>And making merchants pay is my solemn vow!)<br><br>But I feel guilty about the worms.<br>I feel guilty about the fish.<br>So I apologize to the worms<br>And I apologize to the fish.<br>I apologize to them:<br>Worms and fish,<br>Fish and worms,<br>Fish and worms,<br>Worms and fish.<br>*Sigh* So many of them.<br><br>But I honestly feel sorry<br>When I send these creatures to their doom.<br>I make comparisons to the war<br>And the jaded soldiers in the bar rooms.<br><br>I know it's not the same<br>But I can't help but ponder...<br>If I go out and play that game<br>Of war, of death, of destructive 'wonders',<br>What will become of me?<br>What will become of Iridine?<br><br>It is a messy swarm of thoughts.<br>It is an endless circle by life's rules.<br>We will all end up in the dirt<br>And some will feed the fish as worms.<br><br>But I've talked too much about worms and fish.<br>I didn't mean to sadden or disgust anyone.<br>I hope everyone lives a long, happy life<br>And all along the way to have a little fun. :)<br><br>
