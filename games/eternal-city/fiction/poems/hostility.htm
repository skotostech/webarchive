<h1>Hostility</h1><p><font size="2">By Amarad Nightsbane<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

<br>Let's get one thing strait, this aint 'bout love<br>With anger I shake my fists at skies above<br><br>Go a'ead step up and try to cause me pain<br>I just wonder what's goin through yer brain<br>Just what are ya tryin ta prove?<br>C'mon ijit, make tha first move<br>Think 'bout who yer tryin ta impress<br>Do either of us need all this stress?<br><br>Then you act like tha world owes ya some debt<br>And all ya got from love was regret<br>I'll tell ya this, I don't owe ya a thing<br>Seems sad stories are all that ya bring<br>NO ONE is ever a 'victim' a' love<br>That's just like sayin ya were killed by provoking a dove<br>Keep complainin, it's really doin ya a lot a good...<br>What? Ya act like ya thought it would....<br><br>Got no right to complain<br>Yer insane<br>Say I aint sensitive?<br>You've never felt real pain<br>You survive<br>Now thrive<br>Life's a miracle<br>So stay alive<br><br>If ya can't take tha 'its get outta tha way<br>Save yer tears fer a rainy day<br>Go a'ead n' whine<br>A waste a my time<br>Bare yer burdens with pride<br>Or just go run n' 'ide<br>Time ya got yerself checked<br>I owe ya no respect
