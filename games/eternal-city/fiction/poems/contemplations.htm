<h1>Contemplations</h1><p><font size="2">By Tenshal B. Terris<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

I once saw my shadow in the night<br>I realized it was the reflection of my soul<br>It resembled my body, but was black and faceless<br>It was distorted, stretched and pulled compared to my body<br>And the shadow never looks to its source<br>It is too ashamed to lay eyes upon its origin<br>The true reflection of a manís soul lies in his shadow<br>* * *<br>I once lay in a field at midnight<br>I turned my eyes to the sky and saw the abundance of stars<br>The dark gray moon hung in all its majesty<br>Lucifal, Aera and Invex shown oíer head<br>My troubles seemed trivial<br>Myself, my home, and even great Iridine were insignificant<br>The moons and stars are the true powers<br>They are the greatest wonders of the world<br>* * *<br>Why do we work?<br>What is the true point of payment?<br>The goal to gain more talents, denars, sterces, and even sens--<br>It is an utter waste of time, energy, and talent<br>True human talent<br>Our fathers hunted to live, and their fathers hunted<br>And yet we hunt for slivers of metal<br>Odd, is it not?
