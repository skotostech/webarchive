I can't find a rhyme in all my reason<br>I've lost sence of time and all season<br>Feel I've been beaten down<br>By the words of men who have no grounds<br><br>Can't sleep beneath the tree of wisdom<br>When your ax has cut the roots that feed them<br>Forked tongues in bitter mouths<br>Can drive a man to bleed from inside out<br><br>I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine<br>Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind<br>HUman pride sings a vengeful song<br>Inspired by the times you've been walked on<br><br>My stage is shared with many millions<br>Who lift their hands up high because they fill this<br>We are one, We are strong<br>The more you hold us down, the more we press on
