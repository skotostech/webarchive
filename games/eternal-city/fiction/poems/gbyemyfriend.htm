<h1>Goodbye, My Friend</h1><p><font size="2">By  Achmed the Snake<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

So long, farewell to you,<br>you've come to the end of your lofe.<br>It's all been wonderful,<br>a lovely and wonderful time.<br><br>We've had some good times,<br>we've been through the bad.<br>If I could could see your face now,<br>I know it would not be sad.<br><br>Look at those who have gone before,<br>they all managed to even the score.<br>When the book of their lives began to close,<br>They all stood tall, drew their bows,<br>and managed one last shot at the evil they face.<br>Then left this world without disgrace.<br><br>You tried to do this my friend,<br>when that blade came for your side.<br>You took the cut and screamed with rage<br>jumped to your feet, but alas<br>the string on your bow was cut in half.<br>So you pulled a knife and lunged at your foe,<br>but your life was up, it was time to go.<br><br>I tried to save you,<br>I did all I could,<br>I tried to pull you from the bandit wood.<br><br>But I was new to war and death..<br>I could not get you out,<br>before you breathed your last breath.<br><br>I took you to a healer's place,<br>Everyone said you were dead.<br>There was no one there,<br>who could make you lift your head.<br><br>I cried all night and most of the day,<br>wondering why you jumped in the way.<br>That blow you took was meant for me.<br>So goodbye my friend for eternity.<br><br>Let it be known that your memory lives on.<br>Even though you have gone.<br>Goodbye, my friend.
