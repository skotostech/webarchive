<h1>Encounter</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Shade <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Neither remember where they met<br>
When their hands first touched<br>
Their gazes locked<br>
Their hearts became one<br>
They cannot say.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">She remembers only<br>
The set of his shoulders<br>
blocking the sun from her dazzled sight<br>
The arch of his brow<br>
His hand steadying her traitor steps<br>
These etched themselves in her heart.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">He saw only<br>
The sweet curve of her<br>
The forbidden violets of her eyes<br>
Felt the hearth-promise<br>
in the slight weight he guarded<br>
Knew only, he had found home.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Who could guess they would tread that path<br>
Skirt the snares of fear and tradition<br>
Evade the tangled nets of honor and duty.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">But who seeing them<br>
Watching as they forsook both sun and moon<br>
Choosing instead the promise<br>
laid in their hearts and blood and bones<br>
could wish them to have failed.<br>
</font></p>
