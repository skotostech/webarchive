<h1>Love's Grace</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Laskari<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> 
What Goddess or Nymph can claim my love's beauty?<br>
What Spirit can match her mystic?<br>
So deep are her eyes, I am lost in them as in the night itself.<br>
A night of joy, a night of joy, a night of splendor.<br>
Her dark tresses, a black to Raven white with envy. <br><br>

My fair love, her smile is a joy to my heart.<br>
My fair love, she has a dancer's grace. <br>
She walks in that hypnotizing rhythm that lies in a woman's hips. <br>
A dancer's grace indeed, my love. <br><br>

By all Gods, and all Stars, she is fair!<br>
How the light catches her, just so.<br>
No artist could paint such beauty, such perfection even in it's flaws.<br><br> 

A dancer's grace, my love, and a painter's hands, so slim so soft. <br>
Her touch is as light and warm as a summer breeze. <br>
Her caress is beyond the Grace of the Swan. <br><br>

Her lips are as a blossom, and I would say rose, yet rose is too flamboyant for her.<br>
She is some shyer flower, a softer, thornless bud of green. <br>
More loving, and less prickly is She.
