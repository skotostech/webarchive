<h1>Ode to a Thief</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">You are cunning and sly and quick with your hand.<br>
You have skills that will feed you no matter the land.<br>
You love patricians and things that do shine.<br>
You are often quite happy with posca for wine.<br>
<br>
The world is your friend though they know it not<br>
and you wouldn't mind owning all that they got.<br>
With a knife in hand and a swish from your blade.<br>
You walk off happily knowing you're paid.<br>
<br>
You're life is adventure, though dangerious it be.<br>
And your bank account proves that you're happy.<br>
But the drive that you have makes you want more.<br>
And sometimes you land at the constables door.<br>
<br>
The fighters all chase you, their pouch in your hand.<br>
But often your escape is already planned.<br>
Their sens and their cents and other things to.<br>
And sometimes you steal things for something to do.<br>
For you are a theif, though bad as it sounds.<br>
And the wealthy should fear when you are around.<br>
But lost in their wealth you slip from their mind.<br>
So once in a while you have to remind.<br>
<br>
Your theif friends they love you, and the constables to.<br>
But those that lose out would love to kill you.<br>
You have so much loot it's all hard to sort.<br>
but you enjoy your life no matter how short.</font><br>
