<h1>Memories of Blood</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Appolus <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> <br>
the ruby red of sunset<br>
mirroring the rage<br>
of man upon the grave<br>
of his butchered lover<br>
<br>
the rage recedes from his mind<br>
giving room for thought<br>
a memory locked in sorrow<br>
coming to the front<br>
<br>
once again he's back upon<br>
the threshold of his home<br>
speaking with his loved one<br>
'neath the starry sky<br>
<br>
from near the brush<br>
and across the field<br>
comes the sound of marching<br>
and the torchlight of an army<br>
<br>
the fight erupts and houses burn<br>
trapping men inside them<br>
the smell of blood the new burned flesh<br>
permeates his nostrils<br>
<br>
he panics, runs, and tries to hide<br>
from the carnage wrought behind him<br>
a flies forth and cuts his back<br>
a searing pain erupts<br>
<br>
his body fails<br>
and falls down flat<br>
he hits his head and all is black<br>
and once again he's here<br>
<br>
