<h1>Night Time Views</h1>

<p><font size="2">By a quiet poet</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> 
When you look into the night, do you see what I see? <br>
Do you see the faint glimmer of moonlight caught in eyes of strangers?  <br>
Does you heart skip a beat with a rustle of leaves?  <br>
Do you think you hear heavy footsteps of distant pursuers? <br> 
What is it that you see in the night?  <br>
Do you wish to see what I see?  <br>
The twinkling of the stars on their bed of black,  <br>
The moon with its ever-present halo,  <br>
casting a glow on the water,  <br>
The calm that seems to cloak the city while children dream safe in their beds... <br>
The next time you are walking in the night,  <br>
Take the time, dim your light, <br>
and look past what you see,  <br>
Try to see what I see.  <br>
