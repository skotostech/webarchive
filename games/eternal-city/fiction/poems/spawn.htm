<h1>The Raven Spawn</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Appolus <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> The rage inside a heart of evil<br>
muffling the good within<br>
the eyes as red as fresh spilled blood<br>
the Raven spawn awakens<br>
<br>
A prick of crimson in the night<br>
his eyes are brightly burning<br>
the hatred flowing in his veins<br>
the Raven spawn awakens<br>
<br>
An evil deed he plans to do<br>
a heinous crime he plots<br>
his machinations tainted<br>
the Raven spawn awakens<br>
<br>
He shambles 'mongst the rustling leaves<br>
his hands are bent to claws<br>
a hideous form of twisted sinew<br>
the Raven spawn awakens<br>
<br>
A devil now no longer human<br>
his drives no longer sane<br>
the bloodlust is his only crave<br>
the Raven spawn awakens<br>
<br>
Atop the corpse of men he feeds<br>
his teeth are stained with blood<br>
the only way to free his torment<br>
the Raven spawn awakens<br>
<br>
He lurks within the hearts of men<br>
just waiting to be released<br>
whenever man is filled with anger<br>
the Raven spawn awakens<br>
<br>
