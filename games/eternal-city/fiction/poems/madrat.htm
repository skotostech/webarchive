<h1>An Elegy On The Death Of a Mad Rat</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Niltag the Healer <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Good people all, of every sort,<br>
Give ear unto my song,<br>
And if you find it wondrous short,<br>
It cannot hold you long.<br>
<br>
In Iridine there was a man,<br>
Of a whom the world might say,<br>
That still a goodly race he ran,<br>
Whene'er he went to pray.<br>
<br>
A kind and gentle heart he had,<br>
To comfort friends and foes;<br>
The naked every day he clad,<br>
Using his own clothes.<br>
<br>
And in that town a dump was found,<br>
And many rats there be,<br>
Both large, small, rat, and hound,<br>
And curs at low degree.<br>
<br>
This rat and man at first were friends;<br>
But then a fight began,<br>
The rat, to gain some private ends,<br>
Went mad, and bit the man.<br>
<br>
Around from all the neighboring streets<br>
The won'dring neighbors ran,<br>
And swore the rat had lost his wits, <br>
To bite so good a man. <br>
<br>
The wound it seemed both sore and sad, <br>
To every Citizen's eye;<br>
And while they swore the rat was mad,<br>
They swore the man would die.<br>
<br>
But soon a wonder came to light,<br>
That showed the rouges they lied,<br>
The man recovered of the bite<br>
Twas the rat that died.</font></p>
