<p><font size="2">Have you ever loved someone?<br>
Loved them more then the sun itself? <br>
More then all the world can hold? <br>
I have <br>
<br>
Have you loved them so much<br>
that you are with them in your dreams, <br>
in your thoughts, every moment of your life? <br>
I have <br>
<br>
Have you ever loved someone? <br>
Ever desired to wake every morning next to them? <br>
and dreamed of falling to sleep the same? <br>
I have <br>
<br>
I have loved and still do<br>
As i always intend to I have loved cause I have you <br>
<br>
Ever love someone so much<br>
that when they are away it tears you up<br>
Makes you want to sit and cry? <br>
I have <br>
<br>
Ever spend the time alone<br>
Wishing they would return home<br>
Wondering if they will again<br>
I have <br>
<br>
Ever dreamed that they were there<br>
acting like they gave a care<br>
but then woke to find them gone? <br>
I have <br>
<br>
I have loved and still do<br>
as i always intend to<br>
I have loved cause i have you <br>
<br>
Ever loved someone so much<br>
that your words don't mean enough<br>
and everything you say is wrong? I have <br>
<br>
Ever cared more then could be<br>
but your hands were tied and you could not see<br>
Wishing you could do much more? <br>
I have <br>
<br>
Ever thought to say goodbye<br>
would just make you want to die<br>
have you ever loved someone? <br>
I have <br>
<br>
I have loved and still do<br>
As i always intend to<br>
I have loved cause i have you...... </font></p>
