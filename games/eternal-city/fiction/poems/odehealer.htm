<h1>Ode to a Healer</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">You carry a smile and a bag full of things.<br>
You seldom have gold or wear fancy rings.<br>
Without a weapon like a warrior you fight.<br>
For death is your foe, and you work day and night.<br>
<br>
You are known for your mercy, and hands that are steady.<br>
When danger calls you run to be ready.<br>
For you know in your heart that if you're not there,<br>
Your friends will have more then danger to fear.<br>
<br>
You are loved by all and hated by death.<br>
You pray to never see ones dying breath.<br>
With bandage in hand you'll stand and defend.<br>
Chasing away death in the end.<br>
<br>
For you are a healer,your job is to heal.<br>
Your happiness based on how others feel.<br>
You come when they call as fast as you can.<br>
You'll heal and beat death untill your end.</font></p>
