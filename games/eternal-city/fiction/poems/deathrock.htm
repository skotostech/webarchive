  Death Upon the Rock
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By Nookie420</FONT>
<P>
<SMALL>Once upon a midnight evening,<BR>
Looking toward a rock, and upon there seeing,<BR>
A slender figure, seeming frail and small of shape.<BR>
I felt a chill begin to form as a stared at her cape.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Stained red with blood, and backer than night,<BR>
I felt a fear that I could not fight.<BR>
Deep into that darkened cape I saw a demon glaring back,<BR>
But a demand it was not&#151;it was a void&#151;blacker than the deepest
black.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I looked back to the woman on the rock,<BR>
Perching there like some feathered hawk.<BR>
Feathered with a ravens feathers...black as death, <BR>
Without a pulse; without a breath.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Out in the night I saw my fears,<BR>
My heart was empty, and without cheer.<BR>
Like a Raven sitting there.<BR>
Without a soul; completely bare.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Bare of emotion, bare of life,<BR>
Just standing there within the strife. <BR>
It was not a mere bird of earth,<BR>
It was a devils unwholesome birth.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>It was a messenger, come to take the souls,<BR>
Of the dead, and scorch them like fiery coals. <BR>
It was the courier to collect the last,<BR>
Of a life that is now passed. </SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>The Reaper she must truly be,<BR>
It is plain for my eyes to see.<BR>
Now my heart is filled with dread.<BR>
She is here, for I am dead...</SMALL>
