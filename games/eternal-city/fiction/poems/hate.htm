<h1>Hate</h1><p><font size="2">By Razlin <br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

I repent this day, for the sins I have done<br>Fighting and cursing, like some drunken bum<br>But that is me, why should I die<br>For not once in my life, have I lied
<br><br>
Attacking those, that maim and kill<br>Maybe I should go, for cheaper thrills<br>Other approach me, about my behavior<br>Just because, I'm no damn savior
<br><br>
Leave me be, and look in my past<br>For me and my blood, I am the last<br>Why should you judge, what is right and fair<br>Because of you, I'm losing my hair<br>
<br>I always live for others, doing what they say<br>But now, this is my day<br>I'll do what I want, be who I want to be<br>And you can join me, ha, for a small fee<br>
<br>But why should you care, you insignificant speck<br>I'll beat your arse, and spill your blood on the deck<br>Then you'll tell your friends, and they'll get their revenge<br>I'll be in the pub, going on a drinking binge<br>
<br>So I'm saying this, to all out there<br>You catch me on a bad day, I just won't care<br>This is all I'll say, about this hate<br>Cause we all...must choose our fate<br>
