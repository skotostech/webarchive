<h1>A Letter From The Field</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dear love, <br>
I write this letter from my heart<br>
to share my thoughts before I part.<br>
For upon this field of blood I sit<br>
my waist is slashed, my thigh is slit.<br>
<br>
Dear love,<br>
I know not if you'll recieve this letter<br>
but maybe then it's for the better.<br>
My friends and I may die here<br>
but it isn't death we've come to fear.<br>
<br>
Dear love,<br>
My greatest fear I have to say,<br>
is not seeing your smile just one more day,<br>
not touching your hair full of the sun,<br>
not feeling your warmth when the day is done.<br>
<br>
Dear love,<br>
Your eyes so blue, deep as the sea.<br>
Oft times I wish you were here with me.<br>
Your touch would make me forget this war<br>
and all the pain that I have bore.<br>
<br>
Dear love,<br>
These cinners here have given their best<br>
often putting us through quite a test.<br>
Many have died on the field this day.<br>
I feel my own life draining away.<br>
<br>
Dear love,<br>
My time is short, I must fight on,<br>
my love for you it still burns strong,<br>
but if this note falls in your hands<br>
then know i've died for our land.<br>
<br>
Dear love,<br>
Know i've fought for Iridine<br>
for all that is yours and is mine<br>
know I gave my life willingly.<br>
My dying hope is your face to see.<br>
<br>
Dear love,<br>
With this I close for I must rest,<br>
my heart barely pumping in my chest,<br>
my breathing is shallow, but to you I must write,<br>
and send my love and my final goodnight.</font></p>
