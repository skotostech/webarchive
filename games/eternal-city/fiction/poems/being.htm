<h1>The Somewhat Silly Great Chain of Being</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Gotbells<br>

<br>

This is a story <br>
It may get a little gory<br> 
But I don't think <br>
You will see it as boring 
<br><br>

A man had a sword <br>
He beheaded his lord <br>
And blood spilled <br>
All over the floor 
<br><br>

He put his head <br>
Onto the bed <br>
Then he blamed it on the guards<br> 
That's what he said 
<br><br>

But interrupting the Great Chain of Being <br>
Ain't as smart as he will soon be seing <br>
For what goes around, comes around <br>
To whomever seems mean 
<br><br>

So as I said <br>
He was laying in his bed <br>
He looked up to a head <br>
Of his son standing legs spread<br>
<br>
With a sword to cleave his noggin<br>
An apparatus of interrupting the Great Chain of Being
