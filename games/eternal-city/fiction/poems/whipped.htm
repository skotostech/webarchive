<h1>Whipped too many Times</h1><p><font size="2">By Amarad<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

~~written in blood on a torn blanket taken from a dead vineyard slave~~<br><br>"Whipped Too Many Times"<br>=======================<br>I lay with a bloody nose in my hole, cold and damp<br>You swing at me while I'm defenseless, aint you the champ?<br>Now you've taken everything and left only a mess<br>You just want to see it broken, bloodied, and undressed<br>With the whip to my shoulder<br>My side to the boulder<br>But I push on like a soldier<br>As my hatred gets colder<br>I dream of fields without blood, tears and fear<br>When the master approaches, it's screams that I hear<br>It's just a grim screw up, are the broken bones mine?<br>As my sister falls limp beside me by grand design<br><br>It's about time these evil overseers meet my fist<br>My heart beats the play list, driven to say this<br>I push you past the bodies of my friends<br>About time your power ends<br>Broken nose, torn clothes<br>The vine grows<br>With that sweet taste of greed<br>as the cell doors close<br><br>My future's a shattered disaster<br>YES MASTER!<br>I bow to your feet, eyes plastered<br>YES MASTER!<br>You strike me down to work faster<br>YES MASTER!<br><br>My belly's never filled with the rotten food we eat<br>It fills with empty promises and the thought of your defeat<br>I stare with pity at the sunked face of my brother<br>As I tear my breeches to bind the torn hands of my mother<br>Every night I dream of fields without fences<br>Even land where no one's left defenseless<br>We get stronger and meaner as the townie pigs gloat<br>But it's still hard to breathe with townie hands on my throat<br>I fall to the dirt, my road's come to an end<br>Now you carry on the fight my friend<br><br>Our people's now a broken disaster<br>YES MASTER!<br>I can't see with eyes full of plaster<br>YES MASTER!<br>If you push me I'll only go faster<br>Rrrrrraaah! YES MASTER!<br><br>Take the sun from my people's eyes, the collors from thier necks<br>Clear the blood from the slave ships, clear off the decks<br>Neck deep in lies and it makes me wanna spit<br>The sweat fills my life, I'm over my head in it<br>And though no one can fight this alone<br>Stong be hand and heart and bone!<br>
