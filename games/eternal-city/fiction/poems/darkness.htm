<h1>Darkness</h1>

<p><font size="2">
Solitary nights can be dangerous. I should keep moving, but it's too late. Nameless, voracious, this thing that claims me. I'm lost, but the ache pushes me
onward. 
<br><br>
We frequent these fetid sites too often, obilivious to the reek that we carry away on our boots. Wasting away, I feel it winding down. Purposeless is never
far from worthless. 
<br><br>
I struggle to shake it off, but my struggles seem ineffectual. A thicker shell just keeps the darkness from the surface a little longer.
