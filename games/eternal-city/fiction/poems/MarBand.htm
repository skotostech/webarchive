<h1>The Marauding Bandit</h1><p><font size="2">By Blackknight<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

I am the ulitmate evil, as they say in Iridine.<br>I, who am king of the roads, despite the fact that I live like an animal.<br>Animal, that is what many call me.<br>People, you will soon learn roads have no safety.<br><br>Blades, they glint in the moonlight.<br>I draw a sharpened dagger from beneath my ragged cloak.<br>I spot a man, a merchant upon the road.<br>He will soon learn his money offers him no protection.<br><br>I dive from my hiding place onto his back.<br>Kicking him, I drive him to the ground.<br>His eyes are frantic, he knows what is coming for him.<br>Death, only death will visit him this night.<br><br>He reaches for a hidden weapon and I slip the dagger between his ribs.<br>His eyes stare at me, shocked and then they cloud over.<br>I take the pouches of money he is wearing as well as the valuables in his sack.<br>I then draw out his hidden weapon, an iron gladius, very fine indeed.<br><br>Secreting the loot beneath my cloak, I run into the forest.<br>I hear the astonished voices as travellers discover his body.<br>Cries of shock and the sound of weapons being drawn alert my senses.<br>I run back to my cave, where it is safe.<br><br>I put the loot in the wooden chests.<br>The cave is jammed full of valuables.<br>Despite this, I crouch over a fire.<br>Tomorrow, I will do it all over again.
