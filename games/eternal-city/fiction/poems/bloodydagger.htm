  The Bloody Dagger
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By Othelia</FONT>
<P>
<SMALL>The dagger shone in moonlit glory,<BR>
Glinting its furious, destructive stories;<BR>
restrained in my scabbard, it seemed to cry<BR>
"Let me free, someone must die!"</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>A bandit appeared,with devious eyes;<BR>
once again the dagger cries.<BR>
The steely power took over my head,<BR>
Within an instant,this man was dead.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Then came a beggar,reaching his hand;<BR>
I reached mine for my scabbard band.<BR>
The steely power took over my head,<BR>
Within an instant,this man was dead.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Next was a worker,with a shining tool;<BR>
Jeering and laughing was the broken-backed fool.<BR>
The steely power took over my head,<BR>
Within an instant,this man was dead.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I looked at that dagger,Stained with blood,<BR>
The evil inside me had eaten the good.<BR>
The shame i felt ate me away,<BR>
I couldnt bear my deeds today.<BR>
The steely power took over my head,<BR>
Within an instant,I was dead.</SMALL>
