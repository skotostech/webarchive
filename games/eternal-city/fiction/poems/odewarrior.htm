<h1>ODE TO A WARRIOR</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
You stand blazened and tall ready to fight. For your honor and wealth you'll battle all
night. You'll raise up your weapon high in the air untill you force your enemies to scream
in despair. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Your armor is the best that money can buy. You owe your life to your god
on high, for in the battle you seldom retreat untill you can no longer stand on your feet.
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Your love is a healer with sun in her hair who when you're wounded seems
always to care. She comes to your aid as quick as she can then watches you walk off to
battle again. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Your most prized possesion rests in your hand. It has saved your life
and defended your land. You carry it with you wherever you go and use it most proudly to
strike at your foe. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You'll defend the honor of many a lady and shorten the life of all who
are shady. A victor you'll come home from many a fight proudly bragging of your strength
and your might. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">You serve as a hero, a soldier of glory. You drink your ale and you
share your story. You're called on by many, and loved by all. A warrior you are till in
death you do fall. </font></p>
