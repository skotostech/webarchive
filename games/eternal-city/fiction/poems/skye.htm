<h1>To Skye</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Carlius <br>
<br>
What was it when I looked at you<br>
What power has chained me through and through<br>
That binds my heart with links so tight<br>
That I cannot live without the sight of you <br>
<br>
What nameles thing has captured me<br>
And made me powerless to fly<br>
The name of love does not apply<br>
Its commonness can not describe<br>
The hunted haunted painful cry <br>
That my heart makes for you<br>
That my soul eternaly will make for you<br>
<br>
To Skye... </font></p>
