<h1>Sparring</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Taliseman<br>

<br>
Raise your gladius,<br>
Raise your quaterstave,<br>
The crowd is watching now,<br>
You ready to go?<br>
The spar is intense,<br>
The sweat pouring down,<br>
It's not over til it's over,<br>
someone yeilding, or on the ground.<br>
The bruses are many,<br>
And punctures all around,<br>
You roar and hold back,<br>
And vocal sound.<br>
The ground seems to spin,<br>
The sight getting dizzy,<br>
Man oh man,<br>
That damn ale making me dizzy!<br>
The oppenent falls, <br>
The crowd is cheering,<br>
As the loser of the match,<br>
Has lost his hearing.<br>
You help the loser up,<br>
Give a backslap,<br>
To show it was friendly,<br>
And run to the baths,<br>
For a quick nap.
