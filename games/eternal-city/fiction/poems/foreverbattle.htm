<H1>
  Forever the Battle
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By theDarknightX
<P>
What ghosts do walk these hallowed hills<BR>
Where once the cry of battle reigned?<BR>
Who are these smoky misty phantoms<BR>
By whos blood this ground was stained?
<P>
Their song of pain floats on the wind<BR>
Wchoring from the broken ridge<BR>
Calling for aid and comfort<BR>
But alas, the spans to wide to bridge.
<P>
Only Ereal can help these souls<BR>
Who have fallen at the line<BR>
Build no monument to these brave men<BR>
This gound be their eternal shrine.
<P>
<P>
Let angels hover about the trees
<P>
And Guard these men of yore
<P>
Kiss their cheeks and soothe their brow
<P>
Death shall be no more...
<P>
