<h1>
Mirrored</h1>
<font size=-1>By Kelixa</font>
<p><font size=-1>The mirrored image was fractured, broken, shattered. A
couple of sad faces reflected, sadly, mournfully. As if they were trying
to get out. Trying to find adventure and canÌt get it.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The light from the window, is shown on the broken mirror.
She picks up a piece of mirror. Fitting it in like a jigsaw puzzle.. Soon
the last piece is placed. Into the remaining part. Only a thin line stays,
from where the fracture lines were. She looks into the mirror and smiles.
Knowing about the world÷</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The world where things are beautiful and not cruel. A
place where things are not violent at all. A world where things are different.
And peaceful. The world which is opposite. To ours and special.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The world she knows, She cannot reach in reality. The
world she can only reach, with her imagination. Since it is only mirror.
A perfect opposite. Unattainable. The world She knows that lies beyond
the mirror÷</font>
