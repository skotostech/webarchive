<h1>Seeing You Again</h1><p><font size="2">By Kobald<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

From the day I was born,<br>You loved me, cared for me.<br>You gave me life,<br>And the joy of being alive.<br>I never thought that I would one day say,<br>'I wish I could see you again.'<br><br>From my youngest years,<br>You didn't teach me to want or have,<br>But you did teach me how to appreciate.<br>I never worried about being alone,<br>Because you were my friend, my listener,<br>And my supplier of wisdom.<br><br>Why should I have to think<br>That I would one day need you?<br>You were right there...<br>And then 'he' came...<br>He took you away from me.<br>I reached out for you....<br>But you couldn't reach back.<br>I tried to get you back...but 'he' wouldn't let me.<br>He wanted to destroy...<br>To take away what I valued most in life.<br><br>And now...now I wonder...<br>Will I ever see you again?<br>Will I ever feel your warmth and love<br>Washing over me??<br><br>Or is it just a memory?<br>Is it hopeless to try again?<br>Should I just let it go,<br>And never think about it again??<br><br>No...no.....<br>Not yet....<br>I still have so much to do,<br>So much to say...<br>So much to understand.<br><br>The darkness of my past<br>Blinds the truth from me...<br>But if I could only know the answer.<br>Let me know if I have the right to go on!<br><br>'....Mom....Dad....w-will I ever see you again??'<br><br><br><br>
