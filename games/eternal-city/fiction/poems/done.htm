<h1>Done</h1><p><font size="2">By Razlin<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

I throw my hood about my face<br>And look once more at the people of this place<br>You fight, the likes of me with your sword<br>It's because of you, that gets me bored<br>
<br>Walking through the land, seeing the blood being spilt<br>I took my own, and snapped it at the hilt<br>I finished fighting, yes, this is true<br>Because I'm done fighting, the likes of you<br>
<br>Come kill me, if you must<br>But all because, of your lust?<br>Blood sparkles bright, in your eyes<br>And your tongue speaks, oh, so many lies<br>
<br>You hold your sword, over your head<br>And swing it down, killing this kid<br>How brave of you, you hurt him good<br>Now, take your sword, from out his hood<br>
<br>You killed this hood, now boast your kill<br>Tell all your friends, about the thrill<br>The kid still wearing, this contraption that brings death<br>He twitches, and draws his last breath<br>
<br>You remove the hood, to claim as your own<br>And see the face, you turn white as bone<br>Because of your ignorance and bloodthirsty lust<br>You see your best friend laying cold on his back<br>
<br>You begin to cry, and hang your head<br>And only wish, that you could join him<br>In the Land of the Dead...<br><br>
