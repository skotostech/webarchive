<h1>Death Rules Over All</h1><p><font size="2">By Mishka Filitova<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Outside the reach of anyone<br>People joke at it in fun<br>Death rules over all<br>Although you may not like to admit it<br>It is true, you must believe it<br>Death rules over all<br><br>It strikes some slowly<br>Making them suffer cruelly<br>Death rules over all<br>While others it strikes quickly<br>Making it painless and very swiftly<br>Death rules over all<br><br>Many have tried not to get hit<br>None have ever succeeded it<br>Death rules over all<br>Although many also like it<br>Many more despise it<br>Death rules over all<br><br>If you're ever alone in the dark<br>And you see a flicker like a spark<br>Death rules over all<br>Have no doubt, it's come for you<br>Your time has come, thus it concludes<br>Death rules over all<br><br>Do not ever try to dodge it<br>It will ger you, weak or strong<br>If you stand down or stand tall<br>Many have tried to intervene it<br>It will lure you like a song<br>Death rules over all<br><br>In conclusion to this poem<br>Many have tried to show it<br>That they can escape it's wrath<br>Don't believe them they are lying<br>We are all in this game playing<br>A game ruled over by death
