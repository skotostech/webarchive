<h1>The Gambler</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Cyanicus <br>
<br>
Hood<br>
The man<br>
Rolls his dice<br>
Hopes for good luck<br>
Watch in agony<br>
As the cube tumbles down<br>
It hits, he gasps and it stops<br>
The crowd around him gasps, stops, and waits<br>
He sees the face, the one destiny<br>
He sees the face, his eyes in great anguish<br>
He lost, he lost his luck, his wealth, and his life<br>
He pondered his place, his fate as the knife flew by<br>
And in only seconds, he was dead, his head was gone<br>
As it fell gracefully, like the dice he tossed moments ago</font></p>
