<h1>Just Think About It</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
Have you ever took the time to chase a butterfly?<br>
or watched an eagle soar high in the sky?<br>
Have you ever listened to the rain as hit the ground?<br>
or watched a leaf as it fell down?<br>
<br>
Have you ever wondered where yesterdays go?<br>
and why tomarrows seem so slow?<br>
When there's not enough time to hear lifes song.<br>
Do you ever wonder where the world went wrong?<br>
<br>
Have you ever reached out to passers by?<br>
Comforted a child when it began to cry?<br>
Fed a begger hungry in the street?<br>
Said good day to all you meet?<br>
<br>
Have you ever took the time to make ones day<br>
with simple things the world forgets to say?<br>
or did you look back and wish you had<br>
said something nice instead of getting mad?<br>
<br>
If all the world took the time to say,<br>
Hello, I love you , can I help you this day?<br>
then just think about the world it could be.<br>
And it all begins with just you and me.</font><br>
