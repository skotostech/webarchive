<h1>Auxilii</h1>

<p><font size="2">By a quiet poet</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> 
Sitting waiting, people rushing by <br>
Someone approaches, a smile appears <br>
There to help, there to listen, there to guide<br> 
The triangular medallion, and blue sack <br>
The most important are the patience and the smile <br>
Some advice, a few pushes in the right direction <br>
Alone once more to sit, wait, and ponder <br>
Next time you have a question, seek them out <br>
Phaedros companions always are on duty <br>
