<h1>Lone Bandit</h1><p><font size="2">By Donatelo<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

While walking to Vetallun, I pause to admire the scenery<br>I sniff the fresh air, and listen to the flow of the river<br><br>Down at my feet lay a small quiver<br>I pick it up and examine it closely<br><br>All of the sudden, a tap on my shoulder<br>I turn around to a man leaning on a boulder<br><br>He says, 'That is mine, give it here and you'll be fine'<br>I say, 'No problem, I'll just find one further up the road'<br><br>He says, 'Those are some nice greaves you got there, hand those over as well'<br>I say, 'Excuse me, sir?'  He wasnt playing, I could tell<br><br>He says, 'Jest hand them over and you can go free'<br>I say, 'You've got to be kidding me'<br><br>His eyes go narrow,  and grit his teeth<br>With a fluid motion, he swept me off my feet<br><br>I got back up, and wielded my whip<br>I flicked my wrist and wrapped it around his neck<br><br>I ask, 'Do you wish to continue this?'<br>The reply I got was a puncture to my leg<br><br>I free his neck, and entangle his spear<br>He gives me a look, a look of fear<br><br>With a quick yank, I disarm the man<br>Before I could strike again, he turned an ran<br><br>I say to myself, 'What a coward, that man'<br>I continued my walk, with a quiver in hand<br><br>
