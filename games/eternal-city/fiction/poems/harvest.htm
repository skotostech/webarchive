<h1 align="center">Life of a Harvester</h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Jo Noir<br>
<br>
There once was a man who harvested the flower<br>
those he picked cowered in his power<br>
he wandered far and wide to find his prey<br>
and as he walked he would to himself would he say<br>
&quot;My what nice weather were having, would you say?&quot;<br>
after a while he waited for a reply<br>
he waited and waited and time went by<br>
then he heard as he picked a voice of a guy<br>
&quot;Rather nice out today, isn't it?&quot;<br>
the picker replied, &quot;Why yes I think I shall rest, and sit.&quot;<br>
So with this man he sat and talked and talked<br>
months later another picker stumbled to the spot and was shocked<br>
It seems the picker was found<br>
with his sack full still on the ground<br>
his hand had a face painted in wild flower blood<br>
a face of a man, who he talked with wile sitting in the mud<br>
for those of you harvest heed this well, for boredom can lead to death.<br>
while it is very easy to harvest flowers to gain great wealth<br>
it is just as easy to loose your mind<br>
then it be you, not flowers other pickers will find.<br>
