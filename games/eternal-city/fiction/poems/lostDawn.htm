<h1>Lost to the Dawn</h1><p><font size="2">By Merse<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

<br>I took you in and sheltered you from the elements.<br>                                    My cloak I gave to keep the cold from you.<br><br>                                              My sword drawn in your defense,<br>                                  blood shed by my hands to keep harm from you.<br><br>                      Wounds great and small I endured knowing you were at my side.<br>                            In my most desperate hour I turn to you to find you gone<br><br>                                          Lost like a shadow against the dawn<br><br>                                         I sit alone and cold in this dank hold<br>                                                   without clothes or blade<br>                                              <br>                                                   Shivering in the dampness <br>                                  I finally surrender to sleep my last thought of you<br>
