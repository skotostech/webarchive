<H1>
  A Bandit Like No Other
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By Blackknight
<P>
I was walking in the bandit woods.<BR>
Loaded down with goods and coins.<BR>
When lo and behold who should appear.<BR>
But a bandit wearing a dark black hood.
<P>
I was preparing for a bloody fight. <BR>
But this bandit did not want my goods.<BR>
Nor did he want my coins. <BR>
He only wanted companionship.<BR>
To tell tales throughout the night.
<P>
I agreed and followed him to his lair.<BR>
Deep in the bandit woods.<BR>
And I amazed that robber for many hour.<BR>
With tales of battle and fairs.
<P>
When morning arrived, he was my guide.<BR>
As he guided me back to the town.<BR>
And while I was walking back through the gate.<BR>
He said to me "Cheer up, ya didn't make me frown."
