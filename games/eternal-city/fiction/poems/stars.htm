<h1>The Stars</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Othelia<br>

<br>

As I lay in the alley,beneath the sky,<br>
I gazed above me,into the nigh.<br>
I watched the planets gently collide,<br>
And remembered how you,with me,would 
abide.<br>
<br>

I closed my eyes,blocked night from view,<br>
But instead of the darkness all i saw was 
you.<br>
With a gentle kindness,your eyes shone,<br>
My one true friend,I cant believe you are 
gone.<br>
<br>

I opened my eyes to see a falling star,<br>
And i like to believe that is where you are;<br>
Resting in heaven,without a care,<br>
And i hope that ,someday,I shall meet with 
you there.<br>
<br>
(Dedicated to my greatly missed friend 
Necros;May Ereal bless your spirit.)
