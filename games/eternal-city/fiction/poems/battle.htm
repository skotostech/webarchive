<h1>Battle</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Ramuh<br>

<br>

Screaming and yelling, attacking on all sides<br>
Retreat, and re-group, attack at full stride<br>
Get hit in the head, legs and chest<br>
Lucky hit on you, never the rest<br>
<br>
Need armor, better weapons<br>
That's why your here<br>
Attack with all ye got<br>
For you have no fear<br>
<br>
Enemies crawling all around<br>
Sweeping your feet, knocking to the ground<br>
Getting cut, pierced and slashed<br>
Need a healer quick 'for your head gets bashed<br>

Attack again, till the enemy retreats<br>
Take your prize, and walk the streets<br>
Return to the city, which you now call home<br>
<br>
Sit there, waiting for the group to return<br>
Think of what happened, and from it learn<br>
Thinking of it, makes a tear fall from your face<br>
Go to the Inn, that one special place<br>
<br>
Talk with others, about what has happened<br>
Boast about your kills and such<br>
Then remember your fallen companions<br>
For they fought next to you<br>
Shed your tears for them, and toast them adu<br>
For your battle, has just begun...
