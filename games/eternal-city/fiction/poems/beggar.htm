  The Beggar
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By Othelia</FONT>
<P>
<SMALL>With tattered clothes and naked feet,<BR>
He emptied his life upon the street;<BR>
A dusty sack of torn,stained wool<BR>
which burdened him with endless pull.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Onto the cobbles fell the poor tramps pride,<BR>
His life's belongings he clutched with pride.<BR>
Upon the soft-woolen breeches he rested his head<BR>
and the hole in the ground was his make-shift bed.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>The salvaged net-bag held a stale bun or two,<BR>
and from under his coat,a dog peered through.<BR>
A small,blue ragball he held in his hand,<BR>
His only comfort in an ignorant land.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Laughing and jeering,some wealthy men<BR>
kicked at the beggar and tossed him a sen.<BR>
The tramp clutched the coin, and of his pride,<BR>
I wondered where it must hide.<BR>
Away in the darkest caves of his mind,<BR>
I puzzled if it would ever find<BR>
A way to escape this tormented living,<BR>
Survivng from twisted,pityless giving.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>The beggar could hear,in his trickful mind,<BR>
The laughing and jeering of the passers by.<BR>
He lay there still and cold as dead,<BR>
And pulled up the covers,over his head.</SMALL>
<P>
