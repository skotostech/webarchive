<h1>When I'm Gone</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Amarad Nightsbane<br>

<br>
When I come to the end of my journey.<br>
And I travel my last weary mile.<br>
Just forget if you can, that I ever frowned.<br>
Remember only my smile.<br>
<br>
Forget unkind words I have spoken.<br>
Remember the good things I've done.<br>
Forget that I ever had heartache.<br>
And remember I've had loads of fun.<br>
<br>
Forget that I've fumbled and blundered.<br>
And sometimes fell by the way.<br>
Remember I've fought some hard battles.<br>
And won, 'fore the end of the day.<br>
<br>
Then forget to greave for my going.<br>
I would not have you sad for a day,<br>
In summer just gather some flowers,<br>
And remember the place where I lay.<br>
<br>
And come in the shade of the evening.<br>
When the sun paints the sky in the west.<br>
Stand for a few moments beside me.<br>
And remember only my best!
