<h1>Echo's Song</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
Just a girl of 15 she was lost and alone,<br>
had traveled hundreds of miles away from her home<br>
with a cloak and a stave and an anger that burned<br>
and deep in her heart a lesson well learned<br>
<br>
was the law of the land that killed her sweet mother<br>
was the son of the law who killed her grandfather <br>
was a heart full of rage that got her revenge<br>
and set her on a path that would never end<br>
<br>
with a father unknown who ran off with the sea<br>
twas not a soul left to call family<br>
with nowhere to turn and nothing to lose<br>
she extracted revenge without having a clue<br>
<br>
the man of the law was killed by her mother<br>
the son of the man was killed by none other<br>
then the echo of wine in a moment of fury<br>
when he moved to take her in not enough hurry<br>
<br>
with a fangstave she killed him and her virtue did save<br>
but with a price she will pay untill the grave<br>
on the back of his door hang a simple blue hood<br>
she wore it and snuck out as fast as she could <br>
<br>
with the death of her past she saw her future gone<br>
with no more tomarrows she could not go wrong<br>
mattered not which way the road would bend<br>
she would just follow it blindly untill the end<br>
<br>
with no strength to fight she wandered for years<br>
a heart so cold she could not shed tears<br>
a hood for protection from wandering eyes<br>
she grew to know how to tell the right lies<br>
<br>
one morn' in the field she opened her eyes<br>
and was taken back by quite a surprise<br>
standing before her was the great Iridine<br>
and an inn called the toga that served common wine<br>
<br>
she looked about and longed to be free<br>
so off came her hood and her face they did see<br>
a tall man with mystery locked in his eyes, <br>
approached her and offered a very kind &quot;hi&quot;<br>
<br>
his simple words melted her heart<br>
and with his help a life she did start<br>
she healed and she taught and she sang a bit to<br>
and made many a friend as most newcommers do. <br>
<br>
she follows her heart unto this day<br>
fighting to keep her fears held back at bay<br>
she seeks who to trust but is not yet free<br>
and often wonders if she ever will be<br>
<br>
the wounds of many others she may often heal<br>
but the wounds in her heart has formed a strong seal<br>
her namesake is all she can claim as her own<br>
but the echo of wine can never go home. </font></p>
