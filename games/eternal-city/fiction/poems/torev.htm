<h1>The Only Revenge...</h1><p><font size="2">By Kobald<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

As I walk down the path of loneliness,<br>Seeing nothing but darkness and fear,<br>Buried within my hopeless heart,<br>A voice of the dead reaches to my ear.<br><br>It says to me, "Why did this happen?!"<br>"Why was I led astray???"<br>"Please, please, let justice be served."<br>"...Don't let my soul slip away..."<br><br>I wonder why I have to be the one,<br>Why I suddenly become the Chosen One.<br>Was this planned from my Birth?<br>If I accept, will the deed be done?<br><br>As the tears from my face slip into the Night,<br>The comforting voice echoes from my heart...<br>The voice of someone I've always known,<br>Letting me know that we're not apart...<br><br>But, even if I try to change the past,<br>Will the balance of Destiny be shifted?<br>This is only known in the hearts of the powerful,<br>Buried, in the hearts of The Gifted.<br><br>All I can now do,<br>Is hope that my place is held,<br>Carry my heart gently,<br>So that no one...nothing is pulled down,<br>By the gracefulness of my final fall.....<br>Seeing the stars, shining in the bottomless deep Ravine,<br>Carry me; take all my fears and sins away...away..........away.<br><br>.....And, as I fall.....<br>Let there be the Ultimate, Final Revenge.<br>The Revenge that can smother<br>What Evil had left in it's wake.<br><br>And.....please send my eternal, meaningful love,<br>To all those that my hand could not save.....<br>Forgive me.....forgive me..........<br>
