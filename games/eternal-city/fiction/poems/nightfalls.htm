<h1>Night Falls</h1>

<p><font size="2">By CornBread<br>
<br><br>
Night Falls. Darkness abounds in the city. <br>
Along these walls, Things are not so pretty. <br>
<br>
They wander dirty alleys, They scrounge for bits of food. <br>
They wish to fill their tummies, But boy are they rude! <br>
<br>
Coming at you swinging, They try to take your life, <br>
But it's you who end up killing, Ending their lives of strife.<br>
<br>
