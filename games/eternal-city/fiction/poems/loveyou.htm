<SMALL>Love is not a whisper,once said and it is gone;<BR>
Love is not a walking stick,a crutch to lean on.<BR>
Love is not the lightning,that will quickly cease to be;<BR>
Love is not a painting or an object we can see.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Love is not a pass-time,to keep one amused;<BR>
Love will not grow stale the more that it is used.<BR>
Love is not a title which makes one sound mature,<BR>
Love is a disease for which there is no cure.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Love is like a blossom which flowers every day,<BR>
But unlike the course of nature,it never dies away.<BR>
Love is like the ocean,full of hopes and fears;<BR>
Although there's troubled waters,it never disappears.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>So remember this young lovers,for what i say is true;<BR>
Never lightly use the power , of saying<BR>
"I love you".</SMALL>
