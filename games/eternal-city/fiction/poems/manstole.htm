<H1>
  The Man That Stole My Life From Me
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By Othelia</FONT>
<P>
<SMALL>You wonder how I came to this place,<BR>
And why a secret I wear on my face;<BR>
Well now I tell you,And beg you these words:<BR>
Do not judge me,until you have heard.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I was raised in the Safelands, lived as dead,<BR>
The weary grey dullness pounded my head.<BR>
I longed to escape,set my energy free,<BR>
But my family there sorely needed me.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>My parents were kind,and loving and strong;<BR>
My mother would croon me lullaby songs;<BR>
My father would tell me of far away lands,<BR>
He held my world in his powerful hands.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>My father was hunting on the night that they came,<BR>
Sometimes i feel it was him to blame.<BR>
A hooded man,in nervous excite,<BR>
Invaded our home in the dead of the night.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>He grabbed my mother,slashed her throat,<BR>
Left her to die as some game he had caught.<BR>
I hid till he left,then screamed out my heart.<BR>
I cried on my mother,her head torn apart.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Outside was some noise,had he returned for me?<BR>
My stomach was lodged in agony.<BR>
I lay next to my mother, my head by her head,<BR>
And prayed he would think that I too was dead.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>The door opened,I heard his shock,<BR>
I felt his horror as his heart locked.<BR>
I heard him cry and unsheath his knife<BR>
He moaned as though he'd lost his life.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>The stranger yelled,and i knew his voice,<BR>
This man was my father,O rejoice!<BR>
I looked around,scrambled from the floor<BR>
But he plunged in his knife and cried no more.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I remeber his face,as he fell to ground;<BR>
His hand brushed past me and,without a sound,<BR>
He heaved to his death,bathed in his red,<BR>
My mother,my father,my lifetime was dead.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Without a thought,I stole the knife,<BR>
And into the night I hunted his life.<BR>
The hooded figure,who tore me apart,<BR>
The Devil of hatred that ripped out my heart.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I found a letter,out on the hills;<BR>
Stained with blood from fearsome kills.<BR>
The parchment read "In Iridine stay"<BR>
The rest of the letter was scorched away.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Weary and bitter,twisted-alone,<BR>
I vowed to find him,give the hate he had shown.<BR>
Collecting my things from my battered chest,<BR>
I had to set my parents at rest.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I set on my way to Iridine city.<BR>
I bathed myself in hatred and pity.<BR>
A few sacred memories,I clutched in my hand;<BR>
And headed towards this talked-of land.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Even today,I am hunting him still,<BR>
The hooded figure whom I swore i would kill.<BR>
Frantically searching for a piece of my heart<BR>
To cling to and remember those torn apart.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>So if you see me,now you know,<BR>
Why I keep to myself and my suffering shows;<BR>
Hoping that someday I will finally see<BR>
The man that stole my life from me.</SMALL>
