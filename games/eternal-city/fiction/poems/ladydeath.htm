<h1>Lady Death </h1>

<p><font size="2">By Katerina </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A maiden once walked in a veil of black<br>
A beautiful girl was she.<br>
She walked in the shadows, and danced in the night<br>
She was a terrible sight to see.<br>
<br>
She had a dark fire that glowed in her eyes<br>
The fire that lit her pale face.<br>
She talked with a soft and gentle voice.<br>
She walked with such elegant grace.<br>
<br>
This maiden was not from our light world.<br>
She came from a place of night.<br>
This maiden was called Lady Death.<br>
She takes the souls of men of the light.<br>
<br>
With one glance from the dark Lady Death<br>
Men came to fall to despair.<br>
She would not be forsaken, tricked or fooled.<br>
Death came to the men who found her glare.<br>
<br>
She cannot be evaded, she cannot be found.<br>
But love may win her o'er.<br>
For Death seems to have a softer side.<br>
Death is searching for something more.<br>
<br>
A man of the light she can never have.<br>
Men fear her taking the 'ternal toll.<br>
She wants a love, but to see Lady Death.<br>
Takes love from a man's light soul.<br>
<br>
Lady Death has a soul, a soul inside.<br>
But 'tis a soul of the night.<br>
The soul of Death can never meet<br>
With the soul of man-the soul of light.<br>
<br>
The souls of death and life cannot mix.<br>
Lady Death will be all alone.<br>
But in the darkness of the night.<br>
One who listens can hear her moan.<br>
<br>
Lady Death is a maiden, tall and dark.<br>
She walks in the shadows of day.<br>
Lady Death is graceful, but her touch is shunned.<br>
Maybe she'll find love one day.</font></p>
