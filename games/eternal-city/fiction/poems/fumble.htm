<H1>
  The Fumble Grabber
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By Cladius Maximus</FONT>
<P>
<SMALL>I arrived early today.<BR>
Without a care I took away,<BR>
A fine gladius fumbled,<BR>
And all he did was mumble.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I ran for an hour or so,<BR>
My eyes still a glow,<BR>
Over the prize I had to show.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Yet in a hard days work,<BR>
Everyone says I&#146;m a jerk.<BR>
The gods send down their bolts,<BR>
And I receive quite a jolt.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I change my name,<BR>
And come back to play the same game.<BR>
I can never die,<BR>
For I am the fumble grabber guy.</SMALL>
