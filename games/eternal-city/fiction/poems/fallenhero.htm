<h1>Fallen Hero</h1><p><font size="2">By Kaylarae<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Fallen Hero<br><br>A million times we've thought of you,<br>And a million times we've cried.<br>If our love alone could have saved you, <br>You never would have died.<br><br>In life we loved you dearly, <br>In death we love you still.<br>In our hearts you hold a place, <br>No one can ever fill.<br><br>It broke our hearts to lose you, <br>But you did not go alone.<br>For a part of us went with you, <br>The day Ereal took you home.
