<h1>Limerick of the Cineran</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Jo Noir <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">There once was Cineran<br>
who would never smile or grin<br>
whos beard was long and scruffy<br>
whos neck was short and puffy<br>
who was short and fat<br>
whos face look like that of a sewer rat<br>
whos balding head tended to shine with sweat<br>
whos hairy fat naked body was a sight to regret<br>
praise to Ereal that only once have I seen such a girl<br>
for everyone knows the ugliness of a Cinerian woman will make ones stomach curl.</font></p>
