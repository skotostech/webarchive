<h1>Town Rat</h1><p><font size="2">By Amarad<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Sitting at the edge of the path<br>A million thoughts, as I reflect<br>Taunt me just a little, I'm not too hard a game<br>I fear no evil, I take all the blame<br><br>Sitting at the edge of the bed<br>Pondering the bad things in my head<br>Always wondering if what they said was true<br>So now I'm in it neck deep<br><br>Even though I had the words to say<br>Didn't think it would matter anyway<br>I don't need the pretty words<br>I just jump right in<br><br>The urge is always there to do it, skin to skin<br>What the hell, here I go, tooth for tooth<br><br>Lying at the bottom of my grave<br>Greed turns free men into slaves<br>Never fathoming just what I could have changed<br>Instead I'm no better<br><br>Even though I had the power<br>I chose to use it for myself, and not for others<br>Town rat I am, arrogance<br>I took my chance<br>No time to wait<br>Just jump right in, I say to them<br>Judge yourself before you speak again<br>No song and dance<br>Just jump right in<br><br>Crying at the edge of the path<br>All you can think about right now is revenge<br>I waste my time feeling sorry for you<br>And all you want to do is harm<br><br>Let the healing begin, or move away<br>I'll weed you out when I reach that day<br>Attacking the weak, but they will outlast you<br>I see my message just goes right past you<br><br>On the throne where a wise man once sat<br>All I see is a stoopid town rat
