<h1>I Would Forget Her If I Could</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Elis Chessog <br>
<br>
I would forget her if I could,<br>
If only i could,<br>
but my passionate love that binds me to her<br>
Binds me too tight,<br>
In a deadly embrace.<br>
<br>
Like the clutch of an eagle,<br>
or the constriction of a Boa.<br>
<br>
I fall in love deeper and deeper <br>
into the dark abyss,<br>
illuminated by the beauty and purity of her soul,<br>
and I'm bound like a slave to his mistress.<br>
<br>
I give her all I can give,<br>
but she with-holds the love,<br>
I crave i return.<br>
<br>
I stare into the heavens above,<br>
for a solution to my suffering,<br>
I fervently pray to God<br>
for his wisdom.<br>
<br>
For in this maze I wander<br>
wonder and ponder<br>
Here and yonder<br>
for how long I can wait for her love<br>
<br>
I try to forget<br>
the pain she has brought me,<br>
I try and try,<br>
but to my utter regret<br>
ask myself why?<br>
why can't I forget?<br>
<br>
It must be the way she acts,<br>
her flowing, shiny haur<br>
golden threads in sears of fire.<br>
<br>
It's the beauty of her sensous curves;<br>
the blue glint in her eyes.<br>
<br>
It's the enchantment on me'<br>
A hazy cloud is all I see,<br>
It's the sweet scent that<br>
pervades my body, the scent<br>
that tortures my soul,<br>
that comforts my heart and invades my dreams<br>
<br>
How I wish I could forget her!</font></p>
