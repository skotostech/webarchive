<h1>The Dreams of an Angel</h1><p><font size="2">By kyraboc<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Alone......alone on a cloud in the sky.<br>A single cloud, and a single dream,<br>Waiting to come to life.<br><br>Alone......alone sits a little Angel,<br>A Seraph that dreams of the future,<br>Dreams of what she wants to achieve.<br><br>Alone......alone in a world of darkness and hate,<br>She wonders if she can take it all in,<br>And leave a trail of peace in her wake.<br><br>Alone......alone with the bright Scythe in hand,<br>Prepares herself to take on the fright,<br>The Fright that holds all the world in balance.....<br><br>But is she Alone to take it all?<br>All she thinks is of being Alone.<br>All she sees is herself Alone.<br>All she feels.....is the thought of being Alone.<br>
