<h1>Thieving Shadow </h1>

<p><font size="2">By Austintx<br>

<br><br>
Your burnt offspring's smoke will wind Peacefully towards the skies Only if you bear in mind That when you go to the sun,
Your dark shadow is behind. 
<br><br>

Silent slave whom the grim lord Summons by a silent gesture, He takes heed, humble and awed, Of the slightest beckoning,
And keeps everything well scored. 
<br><br>

He's your bondman when your flight Is directed to the sun; He hurts not, he's out of sight; Holy rays surround your forehead,
And you do advance in light. 
<br><br>

But your shadow councils ill When you leave the sun behind; He will cloud your face until Your keen eyes become purblind --
He is nothing but ill-will! 
<br><br>

Shadow, sun, shrine, smoke, and glow! Useless is my tale, unless You have understood it. So -- You may choose! You are
just starting; I have long been on the go.
