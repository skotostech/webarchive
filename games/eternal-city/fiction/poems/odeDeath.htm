<h1>Ode to Death</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Taliseman<br>

<br>
Seeing the darkness,<br>
Being the shadow,<br>
Being, but less,<br>
Than I've ever been before.<br>
The shadow,<br>
it's safety,<br>
warm and inviting,<br>
making me whole.<br>
Hiding from the pain,<br>
Hiding from the sorrow,<br>
Hiding from the life,<br>
That I once knew,<br>
and lived.<br>
Love and life,<br>
seem so far from me,<br>
the end is comming,<br>
and it's plain to see.<br>
That I'm not ready,<br>
I will not go without a fight,<br>
death and his beings,<br>
in my strange sight.<br>
Death,<br>
being common,<br>
is a feared thing,<br>
for unless you are lucky,<br>
you are dead, plain to see.<br>
The end is comming,<br>
and I will stand alone,<br>
For no one can help me,<br>
My body, aching to the bone.<br>
Death you see,<br>
Is what is comming for me, <br>
My body is tired,<br>
and I do not care to be,<br>
alone anymore,<br>
or wandering through life,<br>
the end soon is comming,<br>
comming to my life.
