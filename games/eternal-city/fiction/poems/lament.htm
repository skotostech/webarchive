<h1>Altene's Lament</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Vladmir </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Left our home in Summer sun,<br>
Marched on through to Autumm's fall,<br>
Spilled our blood in Winter's Snow,<br>
All in the name of Altene.<br>
<br>
Filled our breast's with warrior's pride,<br>
Marched until our fears dis die,<br>
Bled and heard our widows cry,<br>
All in the name of Altene.<br>
<br>
Took the town we'd never seen,<br>
For a queen but not our own,<br>
Killed a thousand men who we'll never know,<br>
All in the name of Altene.<br>
<br>
Paid in gold by the unknown queen,<br>
Sent it home to meet the needs,<br>
Found another king whose war needs won,<br>
All in the the name of Altene.<br>
<br>
Now we march to lands far away,<br>
To fight a war we're paid to win,<br>
And spend another year away from our kin,<br>
All in the name of Altene.</font></p>
