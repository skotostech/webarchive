<h1>Without You</h1><p><font size="2">By Minxx Mystique<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

As I wander aimlessly, my sight of my direction fails in the darkness surrounding me<br>Without you, my world seems vailed, memories are grasped as tightly as I can manage<br>Empty bed with untouched sheets, chilling shivers without your warmth near me,<br>In the night, I reach over to hold you, without feeling any love beneath my hands<br>I wake up again, hot tears falling softly, nothing but air in my tight embrace<br>The world seems empty, as I walk dazed, tasteless with no feeling except my pain<br>And yet I wander on, reminiscing of the countless days we fought side by side..<br>flourishing in the passion of life and love, so willing to lay our lives down for each other..<br>I journeyed from a world bathed in love to world clouded with inner pain and anguish<br>A haunting deep within my soul of the life you laid down for me, so I could continue to walk..<br>last glace of a deep swirled mixture of pain and love that I saw before the closed eyes...<br><br><br>Y'librai of my pain and guilt, my deep love will stand strong through the tests of eternity..<br>Y'firaiah ne.<br><br>
