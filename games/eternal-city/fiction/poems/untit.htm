<h1>(untitled poem)</h1><p><font size="2">By Pepa Quin<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

I walk through the city late at night <br>So that I may see what is not seen <br>The world around me is full and bright <br>The dark is turned to green <br>The air is quiet <br>No one is around <br>There is nothing to be said. <br><br>I walk through the city in the day <br>And a begger bars my way <br>A thief runs down a street <br>For a simple peice of meat <br>The air is thick <br>The streets are full <br>There is too much being said <br><br>In the crowd <br>I watch and listen <br>Arguements abound <br>Accusations made <br>Fights are settled <br>But never ended <br>Too many people <br>Using their voices <br>In a bad way <br><br>I am glad I have nothing to say.
