<h1>Alone</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
A woman all dark, dressed black as the night<br>
walks into the inn at the beginning of night. <br>
She gazes about as she orders her wine. <br>
Her eyes coldly stare at those who gallently dine. <br>
<br>
A young couple look and smile as they say, <br>
&quot;Dear lady, a love can drive your darkness away.&quot; <br>
She says to them with a voice grown stern, <br>
&quot; oh children, in life you have much yet to learn.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Alone I began..alone I'll remain. <br>
Love isn't worth all the time and the pain. <br>
You lay down your life to watch it walk away. <br>
Alone without love is the safest way to stay. <br>
<br>
For if you have nothing you have nothing to lose<br>
Cause when you lose something you gain only the blues. <br>
Your heart grows cold and turns to stone<br>
. then you find out you were best off alone. <br>
<br>
So heed my advice, all those who hear, <br>
Protect your heart and don't show you care, <br>
cause if you do some day you'll see<br>
that love for you was not meant to be. <br>
<br>
And with this thought she turned to walk away<br>
stopping a moment with one thing left to say: <br>
&quot;Love is like a bird all happy and free<br>
untill it finds some other place it much rather be<br>
<br>
then it lifts up it's wings and soars to the sky, <br>
leaving you standing with a tear in your eye, <br>
with no where to go and nothing to do<br>
and then you'll become just like me to.&quot; <br>
<br>
The woman all dressed as black as the night<br>
slightly smiles then bids them &quot;goodnight&quot;<br>
she glides out the door the way she came in<br>
and no one around ever saw her again. </font></p>
