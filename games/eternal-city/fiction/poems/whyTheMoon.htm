<h1>
Why the moon?</h1>
<font size=-1>By Dragonldee</font>
<br><font size=-1></font>&nbsp;<font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The tides swell with pride as they gaze upon their lover
He hovers over them, his upturned eyes watching all As the tides throw
themselves to the rocks In an effort to get their moons attention I look
upon them and wonder why go through the pain? With so many stars in the
sky, why the moon? Then as if on cue he walks in from the docks And I smile
knowingly to the tides For upon seeing his face my heart swells It skips
its steady rhythm and I know If he would but ask I would dash myself to
the rocks I realize now, why settle for a star? When the very moon is here
in front of me His dark brown eyes sparkle in the twilight And I see the
moon smile at me just beyond him This secret told we walk away and leave
the tides Yet, the moon ever watching stays just a step behind.</font>
