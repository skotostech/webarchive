  Love
</H1>
<P>
<SMALL>By Razlin Light</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>She was young, when she first came around<BR>
New to the city, and the surrounding town<BR>
She was lost, and needed help<BR>
I offered mine, though I'm just a whelp</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I came across her, so young and vibrant<BR>
It felt as if I'd been stuck, with a damn trident<BR>
As I watched her move, I wanted to drool<BR>
But thought to myself, I must keep my cool</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>She had many friends, they all like her alot<BR>
So I left her, with only a thought<BR>
If you need me, I will try to be around<BR>
Unless I die, then I'd be in the ground</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>She smiled a smile, so sweet and so true<BR>
I could feel, that with her, I'd never be blue<BR>
As I left her, in the strange new place<BR>
I thought to myself of her beautiful face</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>We met now and again, talking of this and that<BR>
And all I could think of was this woman, <BR>
I left the city, had business to attend<BR>
As I returned things started to blend</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Many others had come, to see this sweet soul<BR>
And in my heart, opened a deep hole<BR>
I cried a tear, and left the city<BR>
For I was a coward, and had much self pity</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>She searched for me, but I couldn't be found<BR>
I was in the caves, trying to be struck down<BR>
At that moment, I vowed Love will never last<BR>
And decided to put this one in my past</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I became a killer, hired for a small fee<BR>
So that the weak ones could be set free<BR>
I hunted these thieves, and tied them with rope<BR>
Then struck at them, as some murderous dope</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>The thiefs words, echoing in my head<BR>
The connies are looking for me, so I go to jail<BR>
I thought of this, and decided to bail<BR>
I decided to leave the city, and made the rocks my bed</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I've killed many a men<BR>
Taking their belongings and den<BR>
Saying a prayer, for their soul<BR>
Then throwing their bodies on the coals</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I can never love one so much<BR>
But all I thought of was her touch<BR>
Her eyes, and her embrace<BR>
Feeling her smooth lips, against my face</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Holding her close, never letting go<BR>
How could I love one like her so<BR>
I decided to find this love of mine<BR>
And try to be together, till the end of time</SMALL>
<P>
