<h1>Spectator of a Battle</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Appolus <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> lying in a heap<br>
upon the ground in my own blood<br>
my lifeblood is escaping<br>
from the wound upon my chest<br>
<br>
I see my comrades falling<br>
before the onslaught of the hordes<br>
though we will not win the day<br>
we shall die with honor<br>
<br>
our opponent surges forward<br>
nearly breaking up the line<br>
but still our army holds the pass<br>
the battle isn't done<br>
<br>
again they come unto their death<br>
charging at our spears<br>
and once again we throw them back,<br>
steadfast in our courage<br>
<br>
this time the line begins to break<br>
the phalanx starts to buckle<br>
their troops rush through our shattered line<br>
charging for the valley<br>
<br>
as the host of evil comes<br>
I prepare to give my life<br>
but with my dying breath<br>
I shall spit into their faces<br>
<br>
