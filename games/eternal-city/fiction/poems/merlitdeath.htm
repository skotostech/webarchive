<h1>The Force Of Death Is Upon Us</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Merlit</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Your mind is on your work<br>
There is no denying the feelings<br>
Of death upon us<br>
Surrounding us three by one<br>
Choking the life from us<br>
With no mercy<br>
Like a boa constictor slowly<br>
But surely wrapping around<br>
Its prey with a<br>
Slight energetic motion sucking the life away<br>
Without a chance to pay<br>
A glance of admiration to the sun<br>
As if having to much to think<br>
About as you infinitely crawl to your destiny<br>
Hoping to becom famous one day<br>
Just to fly to the top of the charts<br>
On the stock market when you die.</font></p>
