<h1>Scared</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Teresa <br>
<br>
Silence falls across a field of roses,<br>
The skulls fall never ending from the sky,<br>
We run through the thorns in our way,<br>
Forever trying to avoid the fly.<br>
<br>
Noone know better the threat he poses,<br>
She tried to keep up with his lies,<br>
The world of red slowly goes gray,<br>
Hatred sits alone and cries.<br>
<br>
The love we had for life goes,<br>
I try to forget the tears I shed,<br>
The end of all hatred nears,<br>
Love of all ages is now seared.<br>
<br>
One time we look for our foes,<br>
They hide behind what they said,<br>
The emotion we know adds years,<br>
For the first time in life I'm scared.<br>
<br>
As someone who tries to hide her fear, I have some of the worst, Teresa Trilom. </font></p>
