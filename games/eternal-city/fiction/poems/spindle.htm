<h1>My spindle-needle soul</h1><p><font size="2">By Othelia<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Telling me you loved me,walking hand in hand;<br>Bringing me gifts from afar,trinkets from foreign lands.<br>Drinking wine together,whispers beneath the stars;<br>That was the love we shared,not mine,not yours,but ours.<br><br>Slowly it started wilting,the blossom of our hearts;<br>Its petals slowly scattering,tearing us apart.<br>With each word you gave me,something wasn't there,<br>The gentle tone of your precious voice,telling me you care.<br><br>You slowly stripped my soul,peeling my joy to bare,<br>And now its as thin as a spindle needle,naked,barely~there.<br>Then you went,your soul in tact,in chase of another girl;<br>Whilst I was left with my needle-thin soul and a mocking,scornful world.<br><br>But whilst you were away,my dear,my soul had time to grow;<br>And as you couldn't strip it more,the joy began to show.<br>Each day it would comeback,slowly growing stronger<br>And I knew that your words or flimsy affairs could peel it away no longer.<br><br>When I'd finally grown,and my heart was ripe once more,<br>You decided you needed my care again and came knocking on my door.<br>One look in your eyes,I could feel my soul unpeeling<br>And I knew that,again,you were here to steal my joyous,warming feelings.<br><br>For that's what it is,my fickle love,I can finally see,<br>that the reason you keep me,tied on a string,is to dump your emotions on me.<br>Im used as a clown,to keep you amused, or a hobby whenever your down.<br>Im just a second choice to you,but still you keep me around.<br><br>It's not that I don't love you, though you don't need me,though there's no love in your kiss;<br>No,the reason I cant come back to you ,my love,is simply this:<br>I've rebuilt my heart from a fragment to a whole,<br>And everytime you leave me,dear,you steal a piece of my soul.<br><br>OTHELIA<br>XX<br>
