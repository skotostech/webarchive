<h1>Light My Way Home</h1><p><font size="2">By Agito<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

If you question what I would do<br>Just take a good look at you<br>You are no better than I<br>Ignorant fool<br><br>You can call me what you will<br>But that won't change the fact that I kill<br>It's just like music to my ears<br>Screams of the damned<br><br>There are luxuries we can't afford<br>Your hollow truths just make me bored<br>I slide the hood over my head<br>And take to the streets<br><br>The corrupt all scream thier demands<br>I feel the warmth of blood on my hands<br>I'll make sure your pyres<br>Are always on fire<br><br>They light my way home<br><br>If you question what I would do<br>Remember that I am not through<br>There's still too much to do<br>Don't get in my way<br><br>If you question what I would do<br>Take a good look at you<br>I can never be forgiven<br>And niether can you<br><br>I've got promises to keep<br>And miles to go 'fore I sleep<br>You fools can say what you will<br>I'm coming for you<br><br>The guilty cry for my death<br>I can feel the fear in thier breath<br>Judgement is coming quite soon<br>Do you question your worth?
