<h1>A Dream of Peace</h1>

<p><font size="2">By a quiet poet</font></p>

<p><font size="2"> 
The sound of metal on metal rings in her ears, <br>
The fighting seems to never end, <br>
The sides never resting, <br>
always plotting the next strikes. <br>
When will it end? <br>
And let peace rule instead? <br>
Families ripped apart by conscription, by death. <br>
Longing for the day to be held in the arms of her loved ones, <br>
She continues in her journey to end the war, <br>
To reunite the families, <br>
To gain peace, <br>
To finally rest.<br>
