<h1>She</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Aeryll Doman</font></p>

<p><font size="2">So here I sit, after she is gone.<br>
In this place that was but one of many gifts this night.<br>
I too, should sleep, but am unable to relinquish<br>
The feeling that remains. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">That which I have held for so long,<br>
With so little hope,<br>
Has been greater than I ever dared dream.<br>
So much so that I would doubt my memories<br>
If tangible proof did not spin here in my hand. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">My reflection beams back at me from the now still water.<br>
It is almost too much - difficult to stay earthbound.<br>
But careful! Still I twist in the wind<br>
And the knot in my stomach, though loosened, remains. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Tomorrow I will reinforce my woefully inadequate defenses,<br>
For she remains the greatest of dangers.<br>
But tonight I will enjoy and remember<br>
The softest of kisses, the feeling of her breath and her scent. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Perhaps I will allow myself to dream a little longer<br>
And hope for a continuance when next I wake.<br>
But it seems to me an appropriate irony<br>
That we are only able to dance around each other. </font></p>
