<H1>
  The Whore
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By </FONT><SMALL>Othelia</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I awake in the bed of a seedy room,<BR>
the air is filled with cheap perfume.<BR>
the floor is littered with harlot's clothes,<BR>
and the air is filled with memories woes.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I try to imagine this pitiful girl,<BR>
Who sleeps in this room amidst trinkets and pearls;<BR>
Who makes her living,lying on a bed<BR>
when inside the shell,her soul is dead.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>I wonder how,to such a level she fell,<BR>
Into this desperate,degrading hell.<BR>
A door opens,could it be,<BR>
The girl who lives in such misery?</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>Into the room walks a pretty,young whore,<BR>
Though her eyes are blackened and her blouse is a-tore;<BR>
Her cheeks are tear-stained though rosy and mild,<BR>
And in her arms she hugs a child.<BR>
A fragile baby,weeks old at most,<BR>
Sleepy and tearful and white as a ghost. She stares at me with a face of
shame<BR>
And I look back with a face of the same.<BR>
With no words said I could stand it no more,<BR>
I collected my things and ran through the door.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>As I walked from her lodgings , i hoped she would see,<BR>
That she was far stronger than I could ever be.</SMALL>
