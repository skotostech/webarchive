<h1>Pride and His Bride Lady Death </h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum </font></p>

<p><font size="2">He walks with great boldness undaunted by fear.<br>
Fear cannot challenge when his lady is near.<br>
His gaze is unwavering, and dark as the night.<br>
There will be no compromise, for death will he fight.<br>
<br>
His intoxicating presence overcomes all those he sees.<br>
From the lowliest servant, to men armored in greaves.<br>
They get drunk off his glory and high on his power.<br>
They seek him out blindly not knowing the hour.<br>
<br>
He strides in his fullness never looking behind.<br>
He knows his lady follows, their souls are entwined.<br>
He leads all his followers down his perilous road.<br>
As a gift for his beloved to have and behold.<br>
<br>
And boldly they follow him, as if he were king.<br>
Right into the arms of his beautiful queen.<br>
Where once they rest, she will never let go.<br>
She treasures the gifts from her wonderful beau.<br>
<br>
Adorned in their victories, she follows her Pride.<br>
Feeling quite honored to walk by his side.<br>
For she knows that he'll bring her her only desire.<br>
The bodies of mortals on funeral pyres.<br>
<br>
For she is lady death, entering graceful as night.<br>
replacing the company of life after his flight.<br>
She comes quickly for those she wishes to spare, <br>
And takes her sweet time when she don't give a care.</font></p>
