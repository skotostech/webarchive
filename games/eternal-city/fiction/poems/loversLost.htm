<h1>Ode to lovers lost</h1>

Souls can search for a long time trying to find the right one. And sometimes it puts you into situations which can or can not be fun. 
<br><br>
I can recall a time ago when I was a lover too. Only unfortuneately someone else had it in for me...out of the blue... 
<br><br>
A close friend of mine, named Merlit he ran a business I worked in. The Silver Sail was it's name, but business was really in the bin. 
<br><br>
However, A man I had for me A Falcon, by the name of Siradam, who was NOT a ham but was a nice guy the same. 
<br><br>
We had it going for a while, then love ran into fate, as Siradam and Merlit fought and were locked behind the jailgate. 
<br><br>
The fight raged on even in there, but Merlit was the victor. He then put Merlit out of life and acted as the lictor. 
<br><br>
A heartbreak it really was for me when the news was heard by myself, who fainted dead away scaring up at least one bird. 
<br><br>
However, now, it's long ago, so it is out of my mind, but the man who died is why I cried. He was one of a kind.
