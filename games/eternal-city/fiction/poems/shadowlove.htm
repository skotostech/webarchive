<h1>Lover in The Shadows</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Appolus <br>
<br>
You stare at her from &#145;neath your cowl,<br>
wishing she was yours<br>
the rage boils hot within your chest<br>
as you see her with another<br>
<br>
Within the shadows you long for her<br>
just beyond the light<br>
a ping of love stabs at your heart<br>
when you see her smile<br>
<br>
The voice of lust speaks in your heart<br>
amongst the howls of anger<br>
Her love belongs to another<br>
though you think her yours<br>
<br>
The jealousy within you breaks<br>
from its pen inside<br>
You rip your sword free of its sheath<br>
and tap him on the shoulder<br>
<br>
He turns around<br>
you swing your blade<br>
his blood falls on the floor<br>
and then you wonder<br>
<br>
You turn from her and run away<br>
the tears of rage freely flowing<br>
within the shell of solitude<br>
your hatred for him grew<br>
<br>
You realize with appalling knowledge<br>
the thing that you have done<br>
you slew a man to love another<br>
but she will not stand you<br>
<br>
You stop<br>
you turn you say a prayer<br>
the blade you hold is poised<br>
to take the life, this time you own<br>
<br>
The sword comes down<br>
the blood flows forth<br>
you fall upon the ground<br>
the whole time she stands watching you:<br>
<br>
Weeping for her lover</font></p>
