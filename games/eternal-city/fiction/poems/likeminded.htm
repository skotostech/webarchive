<h1>
Likeminded Truth</h1>
<font size=-1>By Laskari</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=-1>What a curse is this thing called a perception÷ For someone
to perceive you as something you are not. To misinterpret the facts that
lay before them, and come to a conclusion that is baffling to the informed.
It is unbelievable to watch something so grotesque happen. It goes against
my conscience to sit idly by and watch the truth be worse than destroyed,
but turned into a lie. For what does the truth become, when misperceived,
misinterpreted, it is twisted into something else? It is no longer the
truth after such a transformation÷. And if not the truth, it becomes a
falsehood, a living lie, so successful as to be called the truth by those
whose ÏPerceptionÓ is so askance. And yet what can be done about such things?
It is not possible to affect someone elseÌs interpretation of the facts.
The facts are there, and what the mind does with them is of itÌs own accord.
How can this be changed? How can such an intangible process be affected?
To affect an intangible machine, one must acquire an intangible tool. And
what great and yet intangible artifice of thought must be wrought?</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>The key to affecting a process is to change something
involved. Some step, some element of the process must be removed or altered,
in such a manner that the process then moves in the direction the will
desires. The only way to affect someone elseÌs perceptions, is to alter
the process of their interpretation of the facts. The only way to accomplish
this, is to either provide them with additional facts to interpret or to
alter the facts themselves that they of course would be interpreted differently.
I would also say that the removal of facts is valid, yet if you are altering
a process already in progress, the fact is already perceived, and thus
it is too late to remove it entirely.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>And yet, knowing the ends that must be achieved, the course
of action still remains vague, ambiguous. It is an unusual way to think÷
attempting to discern a way to alter anotherÌs thoughts. Or at least, it
is unusual for me. Is it even moral, to attempt to do such a thing? One
could call it either defense, at best, or manipulation at worst. What would
I name it÷ I am not sure÷ Yet can I sit idly by, and watch the truth be
destroyed? And then a thought occurs to me.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>What is the truth? I have only my perceptions.</font>
