<h1>Last Will</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Appolus <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Last Will:<br>
<br>
I will not be defeated<br>
my strength will see me through<br>
my mortal wounds are nothing<br>
I will survive the day<br>
<br>
Spears have tried to stop me<br>
arrows too have failed<br>
death is lingering near me<br>
waiting for her chance<br>
<br>
My waist has not stopped bleeding<br>
the sword is in there still<br>
as I lay upon the ground<br>
the blood of life escapes me<br>
<br>
I look across the plain<br>
covered thick with blood<br>
my own is mixed there within it<br>
flowing through the Earth<br>
<br>
The vastness of the ichor<br>
seem to wrap the land<br>
locking the up the World<br>
in its crimson black embrace<br>
<br>
My life I fear is ending<br>
my vision is a blur<br>
I cannot lift my head<br>
but I shall not fear<br>
<br>
The only thing I've yet to do<br>
is say my dying prayer<br>
though if I do<br>
I fear my life will end<br>
<br>
Ereal console my friends<br>
do not let them forget me<br>
each one that I have loved<br>
thank you for your blessings<br>
<br>
Now I repare for death<br>
my soul sits light inside me<br>
ready to escape<br>
I am ready, For That Was My Last Will</font></p>
