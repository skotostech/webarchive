<h1>Solitude</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Appolus <br>
<br>
Once he knew the love of a woman<br>
Her passion his alone<br>
His heart she stole without a second thought<br>
But tragedy took her from him<br>
<br>
She looked upon him with loving eyes<br>
Stayed with him in her twilight hour<br>
Hint of loving on her lips<br>
But tragedy took her from him<br>
<br>
His sorrow deep as an ocean<br>
In misery he walks<br>
He will always have her, she said<br>
But tragedy took her from him<br>
<br>
Among the plains he wanders idly<br>
Of his grief and strife<br>
He clung to each and every memory<br>
But tragedy took her from him<br>
<br>
His life he tries to mend, with failure<br>
Trying to banish his mourning<br>
His only love he held at death<br>
But tragedy took her from him<br>
<br>
His happiness a distant past<br>
Misery his only friend<br>
Appolus makes his living here<br>
On the soil of Iridine</font></p>
