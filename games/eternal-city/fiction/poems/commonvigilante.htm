<h1>The Common Vigilante</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Gotbells<br>

<br><br>

On a lonely cliff I sat, Watching the world move slowly by Catching a glimpse of what the future holds And not knowing the
answer to why. 
<br><br>

I looked down upon the earth, Seeing people walking around in a daze, Living life as if it weren't there, Caught in the rueful
stare of Ravan's gaze. 
<br><br>

I lifted my sword towards the heavens, Holding it proud for all to see, "For I am the savior, today," "Tomorrow, I'll just be me."
<br><br>

Down the hill I walked into The shadowy valley of Iridine's denizens to hack off the heads of evil doers of thieves, bandits, and
all-around bad citizens
