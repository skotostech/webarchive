<h1>Black Hood</h1><p><font size="2">By Kaylarae<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Black Hood<br><br>fleeting shadows behind you<br>gone when you look too close<br>running like a deamon, you are!<br>...the hood's at your back<br><br>haunting songs of fear, wailing<br>the forest is alive<br>run, pray Erael, for your life!<br>...the hood's at your back<br><br>coward! make a stand!<br>your weapon of study wood and metal<br>girpped in your hands..stand!<br>..the hood's at your back<br><br>strike! you're no match!<br>foolish peasant, your blows are for naught!<br>the hunted and the hunted<br>..the hood's at your back<br><br>breath caught in your throat<br>chest tight with fear<br>running like a mad man<br>..the hoods at your back<br><br>Ereal Bless!  the temple doors!<br>open arms of haven, safe!<br>shut out the hood with heavy locks<br>was the hood still at your back?<br><br>calm, slow, deliberate<br>sounds of an old door behind you<br>open your eyes.<br>..the hoods at your back
