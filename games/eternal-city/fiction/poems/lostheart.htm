<h1>My Heart is Lost</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Echo Vinum <br>
<br>
What makes these tears flow from my eyes?<br>
My heart scream out these tortured cries?<br>
My soul cry out in terrible pain.<br>
A loss much larger than any gain.<br>
<br>
This darkness that has filled my soul,<br>
broken my heart and left me cold.<br>
The battle I fight now in my mind.<br>
My heart is lost, my eyes are blind.<br>
<br>
For you my love are gone from me.<br>
Your face I fear to never see.<br>
Your warmth I know I shall not feel.<br>
I blame the cinner's, I blame Ereal.<br>
<br>
My love, my life, my family,<br>
Seems death continues to take from me.<br>
My mind screams out, confusion reigns.<br>
I know not if I can take the pain.<br>
<br>
I bear each day and I try to smile,<br>
My heart cries out for you all the while.<br>
Each place I go, your face I see<br>
but yet I know you're not here with me.<br>
<br>
I know not where you rest your head,<br>
alive somewhere or in death's bed.<br>
I only know that this is true,<br>
my heart remains lost with you.</font><br>
