<h1>I Should Have Asked</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Karious<br>
<br>
Floating in the silence, Suspended in the darkness, I reflect back on my life And try to make sense of my distress. 
<br><br>
I feel the cold wind whipping, Biting at my flesh and skin. I think about my shortcomings, My fallbacks........my sins. 
<br><br>
I remember my last memory of life, Being drug to the healer's. The Bandits had thrashed me And death was my final savior. 
<br><br>
I can now see my love crying, Sobbing at my death. Her pain is overwhelming, Her sorrow in every breath. 
<br><br>
A soft voice whispers to me, Offering a chance to return. It tells of me keeping my memories, But things will also change, in
turn. 
<br><br>
I accept without thinking, Without any questions at all. My minds starts to spin, Into my body, it falls. 
<br><br>
My love meets me when I awake And we travel home together. Our sheer joy at our reunion Makes us both feel light as a
feather. 
<br><br>
Things were perfect, it seemed, Until I went to the alleys one night. While hunting, a strange feeling washed over me, A feeling I
knew was not right. 
<br><br>
My eyes were glowing bright, My teeth felt as if they were growing. I didn't know what to do, I can't resist this feeling. 
<br><br>
I crept to a sleeping thug, Over his chest I bent. I sank my teeth into his neck And drank until I was content. 
<br><br>
A question now comes to mind After seeing what I did to this man. Who had really brought me back to life? Was it
Ereal..................or was it Ravan?
