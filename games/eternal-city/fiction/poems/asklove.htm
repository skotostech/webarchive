<h1>Asking your love.</h1><p><font size="2">By Kate Holderness<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

I know that i've hurt you,not being around,<br>But i want you to know of the love I have found.<br>You always cared,were always there,<br>And my silly ideas,with you I can share.<br>Although I don't show it, I hide and pretend,<br>But I know that my love for you cannot end.<br>There's a void in my heart which I know you can fill<br>Do you feel the same?How I pray that you will.<br>It's hard to tell you what you mean to me,<br>So I'm writing this poem in hope you will see.<br>Although I've been gone,for quite some time,<br>I hope when I return, you will be mine;<br>And that hand in hand, we will walk<br>And of fairytale gossip we will talk.<br>My lasting friend,my dearest love,<br>I feel we are joined by heaven above;<br>That we share one dream,one heart,one soul,<br>With you,my love,my half becomes whole.<br><br>For my dearest friend and lasting love,Vanir.<br><br>OTHELIA<br>XX
