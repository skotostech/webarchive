<h1>burying my love for you</h1><p><font size="2">By kate Holderness<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

It's hard for me, but,still,i know<br>That its time for me to let you go.<br>You broke my heart and left it to bleed<br>Pouring out it's devoted need.<br><br>I thought I'd die,when you told me the news;<br>That you had found somebody new.<br>My world was ripped from my trembling hands<br>You'd fallen from my fingers like scattering sands.<br><br>I thought I'd weep, forever and a day<br>And never find another who could love me in your way.<br>So gentle and honest, yet witty and true,<br>No-one could be as perfect as the God-like you.<br><br>But time heals all, or so they say,<br>So I guess my wound will heal in that way.<br>Although it still hurts, my heart wont die<br>And I know that,someday,my tears will dry.<br><br>There will always be,deep in my heart,<br>The secret scar left by our part.<br>But I will survive and find someone too<br>So it's time I buried my love for you.<br><br>OTHELIA<br>XX<br><br>to you-know-who...I'm sorry for any confusion I may have caused between you and your love. As long as your happy........<br><br>
