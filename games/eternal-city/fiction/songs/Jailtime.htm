jail is the worst part of iridine.<BR>
no one even has food. <BR>
you can even here a pin.<BR>
it really changes your mood.<BR>
<BR>
constables are on your back every day and night.<BR>
they only rome the streets of midlight. <BR>
even if you attack them,<BR>
they will still win.<BR>
then they take you to a place that's dim.<BR>
<BR>
that is why I hate this place.<BR>
dont even have a mace. <BR>
it is very boring.<BR>
while the rain is a pouring.<BR>
and the old man is snoring.<BR>
<BR>
constables are on your back every day and night.<BR>
they only rome the streets of midlight. <BR>
even if you attack them,<BR>
they will still win.<BR>
then they take you to a place that's dim.<BR>
<BR>
you meet alot o' fugitives.<BR>
that is the way you live.<BR>
that is how it has to be,<BR>
you can't have any tea.<BR>
<BR>
constables are on your back every day and night.<BR>
they only rome the streets of midlight. <BR>
even if you attack them,<BR>
they will still win.<BR>
then they take you to a place that's dim.<BR>
<BR>
some people die and some people live.<BR>
some people lie and some people sit.<BR>
but it is to small.<BR>
even if your tall.<BR>
even if your small.<BR>
you can't even go to the mall.<BR>
you can't even play with a ball.<BR>
<BR>
constables are on your back every day and night.<BR>
they only rome the streets of midlight. <BR>
even if you attack them,<BR>
they will still win.<BR>
