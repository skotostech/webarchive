<h1>Let the Lighthouse Light be Burning</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Seraph</font></p>

<p><font size="2">
(A Seaman's Hymn of Ereal, A song of the Iridinian Sea)<br><br>
<i>Verse 1</i><br><br>
Out on the deep,<br>
And stormy sea,<br>
Some poor sailors are Tempest tossed and more.<br>
But there is a light,<br>
Shining from Iridine's harbor,<br>
From the Lighthouse on the shore.<br><br>
<i>Chorus</i><br><br>
Oh let the Lighthouse Light be Burning,<br>
Sent from Ereal, across the waves.<br>
Because some poor fainting,<br>
Struggling seaman,<br>
Will be rescued, and be Saved!<br><br>
<i>Verse 2</i><br><br>
When on life's seas,<br>
You are drifting.<br>
And your soul is in a storm.<br>
Look to the Light of Ereal,<br>
That is in His Harbor,<br>
From His Lighthouse on His Glorious Shore!<br><br>
<i>Chorus</i><br><br>
Oh let the Lighthouse Light be Burning,<br>
Sent from Ereal, across the waves.<br>
Because some poor fainting,<br>
Struggling seaman,<br>
Will be rescued, and be Saved!<br><br>
