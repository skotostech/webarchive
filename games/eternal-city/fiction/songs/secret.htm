<h1>
The Secret Song</h1>
<font size=-1>By Dragonldee</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>She wakes in an unmade bed In a cozy little cluttered
room She hums to herself as she mixes her tea Their song, that just wonít
leave her heart.</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>ìWhere this arrow strikes no heart shall escape such a
tiny little reminder for so many in her wake her greatest friends hold
a heartís arrow and yet for two her scars still show for this little arrow
on her thigh, brings memories back to the love who died without her heart
to call his and of the one who hurt her so carelessly but, more than them
this irony.î ìThe tat placed there to remind her of one. whose dark brown
eyes captured her, and his song would not let go her soul for this man
her thigh was marked in vain hope that someday it would be she could have
her biggest desire and finally conquer her biggest fear for true love in
this world be so rare in her heart it beat for him, only him.î</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>This secret tune makes her smile As he stirs and wakes
to kiss her She looks into those dark brown eyes Saying so casually, ìmorning
my loveî As he responds she wonders, ìDoes he know how much he owns my
very soul?î</font>
