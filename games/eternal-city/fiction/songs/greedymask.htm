<h1>Greedy Mask</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Garnellius the Bard </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The K's were fighting one by one, hurrah, hurrah. It's all because of a
greedy mask, he had his mind set on a task. Steal the pouch from brawling Kry. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">But the klepto mask was yet undone, even though he had his fun. He
looked in the pouch with eyes that yearned to count innumerable coins. But all he found
was air, was air. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">***Inspired by the true story***</font></p>
