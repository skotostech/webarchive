<h1>An Ode To Posca</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Drunser</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sitting there, on the bar in a small glass.<br>
You can bet your ass that it's the best drink by far.<br>
Posca, posca. It's wine that tastes like crap.<br>
Posca, posca.<br>
You'll never remove the smell if you drop it into your lap.<br>
(undertone) Tastes and smells like crap, yeah...<br>
Grab the wench beside you, forget what your wife is making you do.<br>
And after a while, don't be ashamed if you're in need of a loo.<br>
Yeah, it's posca, posca<br>
The drink that burns your tongue.<br>
It's posca, posca.<br>
Good if you want the liquid out of your lungs!<br>
(spoken) Stone Toga Inn posca... you know what you want... and what you're able to afford.
