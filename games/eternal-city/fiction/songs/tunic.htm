<h1>
A fellow in a tunic</h1>
<font size=-1>By Dataylor</font>
<p><font size=-1>A fellow in a tunic sang by Robus</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>I met a fellow in the Toga who wore a tunic. he attacked
me which was wrong and he knew it. I slapped him in disgust and retreated.
He did it again, I gave him a grin and said dont do it!</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>He used his stave one more time. Which is not what I had
in mind. When another went to it and filled with rage, he almost blew it
He exclaimed ÏI am tired of his kind!Ó</font><font size=-1></font>
<p><font size=-1>Well this story is a small one for the tale is very short.
For that action a warrant is issued and a tunic runs away, laughing with
glee as he knows very well....in Iridine, there is, no court.</font>
