  Drinking Song
</H1>
<P>
<FONT size="2">By 200XR<BR>
<BR>
The day grows old,<BR>
Lucifal do your work,<BR>
Let me drink, and drink more ale,<BR>
Goodness... I am not drunk,<BR>
I act not the jerk.<BR>
<BR>
Lustful women,<BR>
Offer yourself to me,<BR>
Fill me full of ale,<BR>
and my pouch dry.<BR>
<BR>
My stomach full,<BR>
My head is buzzed,<BR>
I can't see my feet no more,<BR>
and there's a fly.... I can hear it buzzzz.<BR>
<BR>
Leaning right,<BR>
Tilting left,<BR>
My cup I drain,<BR>
and leave none left.<BR>
<BR>
Burb and slurp,<BR>
Think I care?,<BR>
This beer is for me,<BR>
and I drink with flair.<BR>
<BR>
The end of the song,<BR>
Is comming thus,<BR>
My pouch is empty,<BR>
My thirst is quenched,<BR>
I look around,<BR>
Where's my wench? </FONT>
