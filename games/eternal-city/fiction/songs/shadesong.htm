<h1>Shade's Songs</h1>

<p align="center">Rat Tail Ale<br>
by Shade<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">(chant 4x) <br>
Rats drink from thimbles<br>
Cats drink from cups<br>
Men drink from kegs<br>
but then they throw up<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">chorus--<br>
Rat tail Ale and Rat Tail Beer<br>
Served no other place but here<br>
Rat Tail Ale that glorious brew<br>
Made by rats who drink it too<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Down near the docks where it's dark and damp<br>
There's a little bar 'neath a little lamp<br>
You can search near and you can search far<br>
but there's no place like the Cheese and Star.<br>
(chorus)<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">The bar is a plank on an old sea chest<br>
there's rickety stools for the bigger guests <br>
There's tiny tables and tiny chairs<br>
and even tiny little stairs<br>
(chorus)<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">A one-eyed rat's behind the bar<br>
And on his patch he's painted a star.<br>
He fears neither cat nor man<br>
cause he can drink more than either one can.<br>
(chorus)<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">The place is full of men and rats<br>
and even desperate drunken cats<br>
the little bar mice scurry fast<br>
collecting empties as they pass<br>
(chorus)<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">No one knows just how it's made<br>
and one-eyed Patch will never say<br>
but take my word for this one's true<br>
there is no finer, richer brew.<br>
(chorus)<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">All delights and pleasures pale<br>
Beside the joys of Rat Tail Ale<br>
Rat Tail Beer, Rat Tail Ale too<br>
Made for rats like me and you.<br>
(chorus) <br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"> <center>* * *</font></center> </p>

<p></p>

<p align="center">ODE TO A PRACTICE DUMMY<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Oh I love you dummy dummy<br>
You are my weapons practice honey<br>
I can whip you, I can beat you<br>
and I never have to meet you!<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">You would make a perfect lover<br>
I would never need another<br>
And though' I'd have to keep you<br>
I would never have to feed you!<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Quintus's Bachelor Party<br>
by Shade<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Mighty Quint would Ara wed<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry<br>
He the heart and she the head<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">chorus:<br>
Hey ho Quint is gonna marry<br>
Hey ho Quint is gonna marry<br>
Hey ho Quint is gonna marry<br>
All his friends had better hide!<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Mercurio arranged the feast<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
In his inn with scurrying beasts<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Rotgut mixed a special brew<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
Made it strong and chalky too!<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Zent and Dytan presented the head<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
Of a Cineran who was dead <br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Myrd sipped wine while Shade sipped mead<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
The other guests got drunk at speed<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Shade sang along while Eva swayed<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
Then Eva threw her clothes away<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Eva pranced and Eva danced<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
Caused a reaction in Quint's pants<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">A passing boatman joined the throng<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
He drank, then he spoke Ara wrong<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">A bar brawl soon was underway<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
The boatman left by the window way<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Quint passed out from too much brew<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
A wicked thought possessed the crew<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">They took his boots, they took his sack<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
They stole his clothes right off his back<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">They dragged him down the tavern stairs<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
Quint snored on without a care<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">A raft floats on the Salinae<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
With Quint on view to passers-by<br>
Hey ho! Quint is gonna marry.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">Repeat chorus many times<br>
Hide from Quint<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">If sung solo, teach chant at beginning, and chant several times before
singing chorus at the end. If sung ensemble, chant as continuo against the verses<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center">(repeat chorus and or chant until too drunk)<br>
