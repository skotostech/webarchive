<h1>
Song for Toshiro</h1>
<font size=-1>By Dragonldee</font>
<p><font size=-1>You talk about you and only you, and the things you can
do for you. You say you're more than a meal so I wanna see whatcha got
on the menu Now, if you think you're the man, the only man with an exterior
you feel is superior Just give Kylara a little peek and see if you really
can deliver Your tendancies are short, my expectations are long and as
I see it now there's not much to go on It seems you've dug a hole you can't
crawl out Now I see what you are truly all about Don't brag about your
diamond rings Or the expensive clothes you wear 'Cause I could care less
for what you possess and your attitude needs repair Don't brag about your
body Toshy And say you're packing alot 'Cause all I see besides your big
feet is that you got big socks Let's just say there's something lacking
A flea shouldn't have the nerve to go bragging So pack up your little gift
and go steppin' Return it back and put it in the kiddie section Full figured
in a place that can deliver? Ha Ha not from what I have seen I can't trace
what's below your waist There's too much space to be inside those leggings
bye bye Toshy bye bye It's time to wave the white flag now that this kitten
has let it all out of the bag.</font>
