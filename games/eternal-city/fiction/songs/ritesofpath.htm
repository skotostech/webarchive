<h1>The Rites of The Path</h1><p><font size="2">By Malezzerai<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Rites of the Path<br><br>  Once ye walked with me .. in sundrenched fields and forests grey,<br>  Now ye must walk alone... as i know that i must as well some day ...<br>  I grieve my loss , my fallen kin.. sing sifaro and sifara all <br> With eyes wide open  you walk the paths .. to the Incarna where you will stay.<br><br>         Fear not the paths, with your heart so true.. so bright a life ye led<br>         your pain is gone and your race is won .. would that i lay there in your stead.<br>         Incarna call my kin to home.. And guide them along the Way<br>         Kin of mine hear my call .. i will greet ye glad one day.<br><br>  Road rise up to Meet them .... Erai'Theran ..oh lord light their way<br>  Wind Blow at my kins Back ....this in song i pray.<br>  I grieve my loss , my fallen kin.. sing sifaro and sifara all <br>  With eyes wide open  you walk the paths .. to the Incarna where you will stay.<br><br>                   Fear not the paths, with your heart so true.. so bright a life ye led<br>         your pain is gone and your race is won .. would that i lay there in your stead.<br>         Incarna call my kin to home.. And guide them along the Way<br>         Kin of mine hear my call .. i will greet ye glad one day.<br><br>   Commited to flame this Hollow shell ...To free my soaring Kin<br>   Free from Pain and free from Strife .. never to again know Sin<br>   I grieve my loss , my fallen kin.. sing sifaro and sifara all <br> With eyes wide open  you walk the paths .. Incarna welcome them in.<br><br><br>                                                                                ~Malezzerai DaSallant~<br>                                                                                  ~:-Esh' Erai'Theran-:~<br><br>  <br>
