<h1>Maybe this Old Song</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Seraph</font></p>

<p><font size="2">
(A romantic love song)<br><br>
<i>Verse 1</i><br><br>
Candles burning, Honey Mead is waiting and soon,<br>
My husband will be by,<br>
Hope and pray he will say that our Love,<br>
Never dies!<br>
And if my best laid plans they fail<br>
To melt my Husband's heart.<br>
I will sing this song of Love to him!<br><br>
<i>Chorus</i><br><br>
And maybe this Old Song of Love,<br>
Will bring back old times,<br>
Making old lines sound new.<br>
And he will lay his, head on my shoulder,<br>
And his Midlight love for me will show through.<br>
And maybe we will start to cry,<br>
And wonder why,<br>
Ereal gave us our love and showed the way.<br>
And maybe this Old Song,<br>
It brings back old times,<br>
And our Love is here to Stay!<br><br>
<i>Verse 2</i><br><br>
It has been so long since I,<br>
Seen his face light up,<br>
When he comes home.<br>
It has been many hours I have wasted staring,<br>
At the floor.<br>
Sweet Old Song, I am counting on you,<br>
To bring his love to me.<br>
I am tired of crying alone.<br><br>
<i>Chorus</i><br><br>
And maybe this Old Song of Love,<br>
Will bring back old times,<br>
Making old lines sound new.<br>
And he will lay his, head on my shoulder,<br>
And his Midlight love for me will show through.<br>
And maybe we will start to cry,<br>
And wonder why,<br>
Ereal gave us our love and showed the way.<br>
And maybe this Old Song,<br>
It brings back old times,<br>
And our Love is here to Stay!<br><br>
<i>Repeat:</i><br><br>
And maybe we will start to cry,<br>
And wonder why,<br>
Ereal gave us our love..... and showed the way!<br>
And maybe this Old Song,<br>
It brings back old times,<br>
And.... our Love..... is.... here........ to Stay!<br><br>
