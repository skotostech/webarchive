<h1>What Good Is Hair Anyways?</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Garnellius the Bard </font></p>

<p><font size="2">My sister's feet, she's got a rather dainty pair. And my mum, her skin
is cold and fair. My father's muscles, they bulge when bare. And Me? All I've got is
really long hair. What can with hair really do, really do? Many more things than you, than
you. He can braid it, trade it, die it, buy it many many many types of clips. So to all of
you who say he's effete, all I can say... You try keeping it clean every day! </font></p>
