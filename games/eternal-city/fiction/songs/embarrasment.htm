<h1>Embarrassments</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Cyanicus <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(This Idyan song was originally created by the minstrel group, Cabal of
the Darkhood. It has a heavy Percussion beat and two string accompaniments of two
different octaves [to be sung VERY loudly and with a moderate tempo])<br>
<br>
(Darkhood was at its highest popularity around 13 - 11 years before the republic. These
groups were called Slag Singers)<br>
<br>
Oh when I got egg on my face,<br>
And the crowd&#146;s laughin&#146; at me,<br>
I want to rip out that kid&#146;s head,<br>
And leave it out to dry.<br>
I glare up at his snickerin&#146; face,<br>
And wish to rip it to shreds,<br>
I stand up and pull out my knife,<br>
And his face starts turnin&#146; red.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Oh his face is gonna be a mutilated mess,<br>
His eyes are swollen with reddish bloodshot eyes.<br>
When I shove this gladius deep down his sorry throat,<br>
He&#146;ll think twice about embarrassin&#146; me twice.<br>
I stand up and he steps cautiously back,<br>
His throat&#146;s in knots, his face is sweating.<br>
Oh I&#146;m gonna have some fun with him<br>
Before I slit his throat, it&#146;s gonna be a blast.<br>
<br>
<i>(Chorus)</i><br>
<br>
Oh when I got egg on my face,<br>
And the crowd&#146;s laughin&#146; at me,<br>
I&#146;m gonna rip that head right off his shoulders,<br>
And I&#146;m gonna have a blast.<br>
<br>
<i>(Instrumentals)</i><br>
<br>
<i>(Chorus)</i><br>
<br>
His life is going to end right here,<br>
And I am going to enjoy it.<br>
His life is going to end right here,<br>
And I am going to enjoy it.</font></p>
