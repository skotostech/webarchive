<h1>a simple ballad</h1><p><font size="2">By GreenDaleIV<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

High o'er the hills, far o'er the seas,<br>Fly with the small birds, follow the breeze,<br>Go with your heart, where would you roam,<br>back the the rose colored stones you call home.<br><br>Run past the rocks, fly fast the mountains,<br>Live off a sack, drink from the fountains,<br>go with the wind, fly with the birds,<br>be as free as you can, as you run with the hurds.<br><br>Be not afraid, be a warrior now,<br>When you have come back, take a big bow,<br>But hurry back, I have a feast on the table,<br>When you tell them your stories, they'd have think it's a fable,<br>You know the truth, and you were able,<br>to come back home, we missed you here.
