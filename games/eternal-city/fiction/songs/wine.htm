We do as we please in the taverns.<br>We wander the roads in a daze.<br>We fight for the glory of Iridine.<br>We've lounged at the Toga for days.<br><br>Oh drink men, drink!<br>This wine is the best by far.<br>Oh drink men, drink!<br>Enjoy yourselves at the bar.<br><br>So try to stay sober.<br>There's work to be done.<br>Every man's got a job he must do.<br>But that's all behind us, so why don't ya buy us.<br>A couple of rounds or two!<br><br>Oh drink men, drink!<br>This wine is the best by far.<br>Oh drink men, drink!<br>Enjoy yourselves at the bar.<br><br>So drink all ya want.<br>There's plenty for all.<br>So don't stop your drinking now.<br>For when we empty this tall glass bottle.<br>We'll give the bartender a call!<br><br>Oh drink men, drink!<br>This wine is the best by far.<br>Oh drink men, drink!<br>Enjoy yourselves at the bar.<br><br>
