<h1>Tribal Chant of Revenge</h1><p><font size="2">By Amarad<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

Bright azure eyes<br>Burnt by the sun<br>Beauty withers and dies<br>Please don't come undone<br><br>So a life worth living ends in a second<br>Look at the blood writing up on the wall<br>Seems that something beyond this life beckoned<br>No one's there to catch you when you fall<br>I wanted to say I fought for you<br>But if I did then I would lie<br>I guess that some saviour forgot you<br>Those who don't deserve it die<br><br>Some stories aren't worth being told<br>My fists are red, blood running to the sea<br>There's no beauty that won't grow old<br>Spirits of vengence I will you to me<br><br>Hear the tortured cries of my kin<br>You and I, we are one in the same<br>Let the final revolution begin<br>Thier last words will be them screaming my name<br><br>Her eyes shown azure<br>Out shine the sun<br>The weak killed the pure<br>Mercy for NO ONE
