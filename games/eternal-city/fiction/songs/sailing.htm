It annoyed the 'ell outta' me, now it's your turn : )<br><br>'Twas a cold and windy mornin' in Blackvine (in Blackvine)<br>When all of me money was spent (spent spent)<br>And where the 'ell it went, I can't remember (remember)<br>So down to the dock n' yards, I went (went went)<br><br>Tally lay back (back back)<br>Take in the slack, (take in the slack)<br>Take a turn 'round the capstain's eve this mooooorn<br>Round ship's 'haken boys, be handy (be handy)<br>We're bound valla'va ride 'round the horn.<br><br>So here we are again at sea boys (at sea boys)<br>The same old garbage, all over again ('gen 'gen)<br>And taken we'll be here for quite a time boys (time boys)<br>Join me in singin' the ol' refrain! ('frain!
