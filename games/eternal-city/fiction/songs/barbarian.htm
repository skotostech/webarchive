<h1>A little Barbarian Song</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Amarad Nightsbane<br>
<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2">
Aye, my brothers, hoist that beam<br>
Aye, my friends, break that stone<br>
Aye, me lad, dig that stream<br>
Strong be hand and heart and bone!<br>
<br>
Though today we're crushed under townie boots<br>
Ya can't get the whole tree if ya don't get the roots<br>
The townie whip can snap and crack<br>
But the burden'll never break my back!<br>
For now level the forest and haul the logs<br>
One day we'll whip them townie dogs<br>
They can beat us and take our lives<br>
One day we'll burn thier town and take thier wives<br>
(we got many a whippin for that part~snicker~)<br>
<br>
But listen here for yer own sake<br>
A "barbarian" heart will never break<br>
Go ahead, break my bones, tear my flesh<br>
After a short bath of fire I'll come back fresh!<br>
When the sun sets and the day is done<br>
Then we'll see the townies run<br>
On the townie's land we'll trod<br>
Let em' try to stop the serpant god<br>
Townie scum, can't do yer own work<br>
Go ahead and try ya big jerk<br>
Cause one day it is I who'll be free<br>
And I won't force you to work for me<br>
<br>
You should be ashamed of what you've done<br>
Now I bake under this sun<br>
But we all got the right to be free<br>
So get on an even field then face me!<br>
When yer gone I'll remember you<br>
and everything you put me Through<br>
And I'll make sure I always wonder<br>
Why ya killed my friends and stole my thunder<br>
But one day I'll be back on my feet!<br>
Then! Mr. Townie! You'll know defeat!<br>
<br>
Aye! My brothers! Work all day long!<br>
Aye! My friends! Break that stone!<br>
Show them town rats that yer strong!<br>
Strong be Hand and Heart and Bone!<br>
AYE!<br>
<br>
(no offense to all the townies who don't think they deserve respect just out of merit)
