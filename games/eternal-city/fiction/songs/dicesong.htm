<br>
(chorus)<br>
<i>As I write from the front line<br>
I think; wouldn't it be fine<br>
If I could see you again<br>
And not just pretend<br>
Alas, it is just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
We set out at dawn<br>
All three hundred strong<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I see hardened faces<br>
From various places<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
</i>(chorus)<br>
<br>
<i>chorus</i><br>
<br>
It is now time<br>
To move our bold kind<br>
You are just a dream in my mind.<br>
<br>
Our future is determined<br>
By those creeps, scum, and vermin<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
<i>chorus</i><br>
<br>
As the dawn breaks<br>
Their cutthroats not yet awake<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
We gather our strength<br>
However long in length<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
<i>chorus</i><br>
<br>
The attack is almost ready<br>
Our steeds are all but steady<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
We are ready to die?<br>
Under vicious skies<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
<i>chorus</i><br>
<br>
We whisper the signal<br>
We charge out at the dismal<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
Death all around me<br>
I swing my sword mightily<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
<i>chorus</i><br>
<br>
Both sides are dying<br>
Our wounded are lying<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
There are just few left standing<br>
The dead see angels landing<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
<i>chorus</i><br>
<br>
They are pulling ahead<br>
Above all our dead<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
We will not give up<br>
But their spirits are going up<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
<i>chorus</i><br>
<br>
A gladius hits from nowhere<br>
Mine own armor is tearing<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
My chest is bloody<br>
From my Cinerian buddy<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I hear the dying screaming<br>
Mine own flesh is teeming<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I dare not make sound<br>
For the Cinerians search the ground<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I am surely dying<br>
Here where I am lying<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I feel no pain<br>
My tunic is bloodstained<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I'm slipping away<br>
On the battlefield to-day<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
They think they have won<br>
But we've just begun<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I think about you<br>
And your smiling face too<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
It is now my time<br>
To go beyond the line<br>
But if I see you again<br>
It will be in heaven<br>
And that would just be fine<br>
<br>
Wouldn't it be grand<br>
Just to hold your hand?<br>
It is just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
You will never see my letter<br>
But I think It's all the better<br>
You are just a dream in my mind<br>
<br>
I just want you to feel<br>
That my love was always real<br>
Good-bye, my love, and sweet dreams.</font></p>
