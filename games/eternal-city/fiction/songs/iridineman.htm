<h1>The Iridine Man</h1><p><font size="2">By Myouiijita Mien<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

From across the grassland,<br>The Cinerans stand,<br>Breaking through everything that their enemies had,<br><br>But at the last sight,<br>The Cinerans thought they won the fight,<br>And then here comes a big 'ol Iridne drunk,<br><br>With a mug full of ale in his hand,<br>The old man,<br>Took a step past our fleet,<br>And attacked the Cinerans,<br><br>No one could stop him as his killing proceeded,<br>The Cinerans retreated and never came back to see,<br><br>[Chorus]<br>The Iridine Man!<br><br>The one who drinks ale all day and kill with his hands.<br><br>[Chorus]<br>The Iridine Man!<br>
