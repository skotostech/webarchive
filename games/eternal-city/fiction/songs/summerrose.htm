<h1>The Summer Rose</h1><p><font size="2">By Cyanicus<br><br></font></p><p><font size="2">

A popular love ballad during Tulca's time, soon after the founding of Iridine, the name of the writer of this tune has disappeared into the obscurities of history, but the song lives on in some of the smaller towns and even in the artisan's district of Iridine.<br><br>The summer ro-se<br>The serene autumn sky<br>The clouds above me,<br>Fluttering softly by÷<br><br>The rising su-n<br>Pushing the fog aside<br>Dawning o'er the<br>The fields of golden rye<br><br>As you look at me,<br>And me at you<br>I wonder what's in store÷<br><br>As you look at me,<br>And me at you<br>While the waves wash on to shore÷<br><br>The nightingale sings,<br>She sings a lovely song<br>Her whistles echo<br>Echo beyond the stars<br><br>The flowers wither<br>The leaves fall from the sky<br>Ereal above me<br>Waves a solemn goodbye<br><br>As you look at me,<br>And me at you<br>While the sun makes her last run<br><br>As you look at me,<br>And me at you<br>As the moons shine from above÷<br><br>I never thought that<br>The nights would last so long÷<br>I never dreamed that<br>You'll leave me in the storm<br><br>The whips and scorns of time<br>The winter's bitter wind<br>Are my only friends alive<br><br>And when you return<br>Your face lights up the sky<br>Your golden sunrays<br>Bathe me in a serene light<br><br>Your smile has warmed me up<br>Removed the scars<br>And has outshone the distant stars<br><br>As you look at me÷<br>And me at you÷<br>You are the life<br>That keeps my soul alight÷<br>
