  Antequides' Song

<SMALL>Oh so tall and fair,<BR>
So full of life he was,<BR>
A friend, a comrade, a loss,<BR>
As Iridine weeps for him,<BR>
I smile.<BR>
A memory comes to me...<BR>
Of a rainy night spent<BR>
Hid away from the storn,<BR>
Of ale, of laughter, of toasts,<BR>
He bragged of recipes<BR>
I laughed.<BR>
His concotions so well known...<BR>
And yet as I listened,<BR>
I thought "Boy you can't hold ale."<BR>
Then THUD!<BR>
Our laughter rang out<BR>
Through the rain<BR>
I'll remember him always<BR>
As I drink this tea.<BR>
I smile.<BR>
With every creamy cinnamon sip,<BR>
I recall the great man<BR>
Who made it for me<BR>
My friend, my comrade,<BR>
My Antequides.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>In memory of Antequides, you are missed and never forgotten, my
friend.</SMALL>
