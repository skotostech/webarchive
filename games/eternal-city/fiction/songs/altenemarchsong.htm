<h1>Altene Marching Song</h1>

<p><font size="2">The Altene soldier's marching song, in as many verses as Quint could
remember while not marching or drinking. Sung as more of a chant or shout, to the sound of
stamping (marching) feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(Chorus)<br>
[Oh you men, raise up your swords,<br>
And flirt with Lady Death.<br>
Spin and turn, dance and burn,<br>
To the final, gasping breath.]<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
And Altenes more than most.<br>
They'll slash out yer guts, cut off yer head,<br>
An eat yer eyes poached on toast!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
And no one can say it is other.<br>
No one's as scary, as gory, as hairy,<br>
'Cept maybe his dear old mother!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(chorus) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
And they fight hard and drink hard as well.<br>
Next time you see 'em, scream out an flee 'em,<br>
They're bringin you nine kinds a Hell!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
None of 'em knows other ways.<br>
They'll kidnap yer daughter, commit bloody slaughter,<br>
An gleefully do it fer pay.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(chorus) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
An none may say to him nay.<br>
He'll march all night, at dawn he'll fight,<br>
An wench tha rest a tha day!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
He's quick with tha wine and a laugh.<br>
No he can't dance, nor speak sweet romance,<br>
But tha ladies love his fangstaff!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(chorus) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
And no one can raise more Hades.<br>
Ain't got no charm, he'll break yer arm,<br>
But his big spear's tha love a tha ladies!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
It's all he ever can be.<br>
At dawn he's a warrin, night before, he's a scorin',<br>
Every woman'll kiss him fer free!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(chorus) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
An their women shout an fight.<br>
They don't want gentle, nor sentimental,<br>
They want a man fighting all night!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Every man-soldier's a son of a goat,<br>
An tha weaker ones all get tha boot.<br>
Tha women all cheer when tha soldiers march near,<br>
With their spears all raised in salute!<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">(Chorus)<br>
[Oh you men raise up your swords,<br>
And flirt with Lady Death.<br>
Spin and turn, dance and burn,<br>
To the final, rattling breath.<br>
To the final, rattling breath.]<br>
</font></p>
