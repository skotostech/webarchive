<h1>The Things I Could Tell You About Iridine . . .</h1>

<p><font size="2">By Malik</font></p>

<p><font size="2">One day I spied a rich old man<br>
Who quickly did approach<br>
He said, &quot;My lad, oh did you know<br>
A fibula's a brooch?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">And then one day I chanced to spy<br>
Some soldiers push a man<br>
They weren't Cinerians, I think<br>
They're called Cinerans </font></p>

<p><font size="2">One day I went to Gilven<br>
To learn my old spearshaft<br>
But chanced to look below his belt<br>
&quot;I think I feel a draft!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">I bought a feminalia<br>
To give my own true love<br>
But chanced a man upon the street<br>
Who wore one with his glove</font></p>
