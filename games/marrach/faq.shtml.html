								<h4><b>Q: What is cooperative storytelling?</b></h4>
								<p>Unlike many other role-playing games, Castle Marrach focuses on storytelling &#151; creating and playing out stories in cooperation with other players. In many respects, Castle Marrach is more like improvisational theater than a game. There are no clear-cut goals that the players need to achieve in order to win. A story might have any number of outcomes, depending upon actions of the players who become involved. The challenge comes in creating a compelling drama that brings the Role you have created to life. Sometimes you will reach your goals and sometimes you won&#146;t, but you will always feel like a winner when you&#146;ve told a good story.</p>
								<h4><b>Q: What is the story of Marrach?</b></h4>
								<p>A: You awaken in a small, dank chamber deep within the Castle Marrach. Who are you? How did you come to be here? You explore the labyrinthine corridors of the Castle and the questions seem to multiply. Why has the drawbridge not been let down in living memory? How does the Castle replenish its supplies? There seem only to be questions, but somewhere, there must be answers. Intrigue, mystery, romance and fantasy combine in the story of Castle Marrach.</p>
								<h4><b>Q: What is my role in Marrach's Story?</b></h4>
								<p>A: You are a Newly Awakened Guest in Castle Marrach with little memory of the past. You will explore the Castle and meet the denizens there. As you join guilds and become a part of Marrach's society, you will also become a participant in its stories.</p>
								<h4><b>Q: What are the main technical features of Castle Marrach?</b></h4>
								<p>A: Marrach technical features emphasize a robust social game. They include: proximities to create clear relations between people and things; numerous social verbs and adverbs; and a consent system. Marrach also has a vast alteration system that allows for the creation of tens of thousands of unique items by the players.</p>
								<p>Some of Marrach&#146;s most important non-technical features are: a world run and plotted entirely by trusted players; Hosted major characters; far-reaching plots underlying the entire game; and a responsive customer experience team dedicating to ensuring players have fun.</p>
								<h4><b>Q: Is Marrach a MUD or a MUSH?</b></h4>
								<p>A: Neither. Castle Marrach is most closely related to MUSHes, but also takes some inspiration from MUDs. You can duel in Marrach, for example. However, Castle Marrach also improves upon the genres. It features new, third-generation technology and places a very solid emphasis on a long-term plotline.</p>
								<h4><b>Q: Can you Player Kill (PK) in Marrach?</b></h4>
								<p>A: No. In general, Marrach is based upon consent. Nothing bad can happen to a player unless he agrees to it in some form (perhaps by working with a StoryTeller to coordinate a plot, perhaps just by accepting a duel).</p>
