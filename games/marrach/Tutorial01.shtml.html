										<h2><a name="imperative-1"></a>1) Using the Imperative</h2>
									</div>
									<p>As soon as you finish the Castle Marrach Start Story you'll be thrown headfirst in the world of Castle Marrach. You'll see a description of your locale and a very daunting prompt, waiting for your attention.</p>
									<pre>      You fall headfirst through the magical mirror...

      You're falling, falling forever, surrounded by blackness.

      Abruptly, you come to a halt and for a moment you can feel
      the impact in your teeth. The blackness slowly fades away
      and you can see first colors, then shapes. Everything come
      into focus...

      You are in a large cavern, lit by eerily glowing gems.

      You are standing in the middle of the cavern.

      &gt;</pre>
									<p>That &quot;&gt;&quot; is your prompt. It lets you know that your alterego is waiting his or her next command. Now its your turn to direct their fate.</p>
									<p>When instructing your character, you'll be using imperatives. These are commands (like &quot;stop!&quot; or &quot;heel!&quot; in real life). There's no need to include a pronoun (like &quot;you&quot; or &quot;I&quot;). Just input the command that you want your character to follow.</p>
									<p>You need to use fairly basic sentence structures when commanding your alterego. Most of the basic parts of speech--including nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, possessives, and pronouns--can be used, but you need to form them into simple, clear, and concise commands, not typical English sentences (like this one), full of subclauses and conjunctions.</p>
									<p>Here's a few commands that will probably never work in Castle Marrach, due to the limitations of current artificial intelligence:</p>
									<pre>      &gt; <b>look around the cavern and see what's interesting </b>
      &gt; <b>squint to make out more details in the darkness </b>
      &gt; <b>wait for my eyes to adjust to the dark </b>
      &gt; <b>look up to see where I fell from </b></pre>
									<p>Each of the above commands would return the response &quot;What?&quot; That's Marrach Imperative for &quot;I can't figure out what you want me to do.&quot;</p>
									<p>The rest of this document is all about the clear and concise commands that Castle Marrach requires to instruct your alterego in his or her tasks. It's broken down into a number of categories of action which Castle Marrach understands.</p>
