									<h2><a name="appendix-2"></a>Appendix II: Parts of Speech and the Skotos Parser</h2>
									<p>This appendix lists the parts of the speech that the Skotos parser understands, defines them, and explains when they can be used.</p>
									<p><b>Adjective.</b> <i>A word that modifies an adjective. Examples include &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, and &quot;tall&quot;.</i> Every object in Castle Marrach typically has one or more adjectives associated with it. A chair might be &quot;comfortable&quot;, &quot;old&quot;, and &quot;green&quot;. Adjectives are primarily used when you are trying to reference a noun in a unique manner. For example, if there were three swords in a room, one of which was shiny, you could look at or take the &quot;shiny sword&quot;.</p>
									<p><b>Adverb.</b> <i>A word that modifies a verb. Examples include &quot;slowly&quot;, &quot;slyly&quot;, and &quot;impatiently&quot;.</i> In Castle Marrach, adverbs may be used to modify any communication verb. Dueling, help, manipulation, movement, and perception verbs can not necessarily be modified by adverbs.</p>
									<p><b>Cardinal.</b> <i>A counting number. Examples include &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, and &quot;three&quot;.</i> Currently you can use some of the manipulation verbs on more than one noun at the same time. To do this, use the ordinal: &quot;take two cards&quot;.</p>
									<p><b>Conjunction.</b> <i>A word that connects together parts of speech. The only conjunction used by Castle Marrach is &quot;and&quot;.</i> Currently you can only use conjunctions to connect lists of nouns when you are using a manipulation verb (&quot;take sword and dagger&quot;).</p>
									<p><b>Noun.</b> <i>A word that is used to name a person, place, or thing. Examples include &quot;Vivienne&quot;, &quot;table&quot;, and &quot;hearth&quot;.</i> Every object in Castle Marrach is identified by one of more nouns. For example a &quot;chair&quot; may also be associated with the noun &quot;seat&quot;.</p>
									<p><b>Ordinal.</b> <i>An ordering number. Examples include &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, and &quot;third&quot;.</i> Whenever you are referring to a noun you can use an ordinal to provide unique identification. For example if there are three swords in a room, you can type &quot;look at second sword&quot;.</p>
									<p><b>Possessive.</b> <i>A word that indicates possession. Examples include &quot;my&quot;, &quot;Cameo's&quot;, and &quot;Camille's&quot;.</i> Possessives can always be used in conjuction with nouns to provide unique identification. For example &quot;look at Cameo's sword&quot; or &quot;look at my tunic&quot;.</p>
									<p><b>Preposition.</b> <i>A word that most frequently shows a relationship between two nouns (but sometimes a relationship between a noun and a verb). Examples include &quot;on&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;below&quot;.</i> Prepositions are widely used in Castle Marrach. The most common uses are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>To place objects in relation to each other (&quot;put knife on altar&quot;).
										<li>To direct a communication to someone (&quot;shout at queen&quot;).
										<li>To direct perception to something (&quot;look at throne&quot;).
										<li>To take a stance in relationship to something (&quot;crouch under bed&quot;).
										<li>TO direct another verb toward something (&quot;point at exit&quot;).
									</ul>
									<p><b>Pronoun.</b> <i>A word that replaces a noun. Pronouns that may be used in Castle Marrach are &quot;me&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, and &quot;it&quot;.</i> &quot;Me&quot; always refers to your character. &quot;She&quot; and &quot;He&quot; refer, respectively, to the last female and male person you interacted with. &quot;It&quot; refers to the last non-living object you interacted with. The pronouns &quot;you&quot; and &quot;I&quot; are not used in Castle Marrach.</p>
									<p><b>Verb.</b> <i>An action word. Examples include &quot;go&quot;, &quot;look&quot;, and &quot;take&quot;.</i> In Castle Marrach all verbs are used in the imperative (or command) form. Each command given to Castle Marrach must include a verb. The main categories of verbs in Castle Marrach include: communication, dueling, help, manipulation, movement, and perception.</p>
