								<h3>Gameplay</h3>
								<p>
Castle Marrach is a game of roleplaying, socialization, and storytelling.

								<p>
You will take on the role of a character within Castle Marrach, awakening without memory, trying to discover their purpose. You will have the opportunity to truly become this other person within the virtual reality of Marrach.

<p>
Within the game you will be able to socialize with hundreds of other characters, each playing their own role within the Castle. Duelists, Watchmen, courtiers, seamstresses, carpenters, and poets are just some of the many people you will meet.

<p>
At heart, the game of Castle Marrach is about stories. StoryPlotters within the community manage the largest epics of the Castle, but each and every player, including you, also has the opportunity to tell their own stories within the Castle.

								<p>
Castle Marrach is a prose game based on the Skotos StoryBuilder server. Locales and other people are described in evocative text, while a text-based command parser allows players to input complex commands. Thousands of verbs and adverbs support the socialization within Castle Marrach, which is further supplemented by a vividly descriptive dueling system and a complex alteration system.
