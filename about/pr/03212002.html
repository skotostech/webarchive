						<h2><b>Skotos Releases Strategic Hegemony Game</b></h2>
						<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, March 21, 2002</b> &#151; Following a closed beta test, Skotos Tech has now released its newest game, Galactic Emperor: Hegemony, to the entire Internet. This game of strategic warfare and diplomacy gives players 21 days to conquer the galaxy. New players can take advantage of a Skotos trial account to play for free.</p>
						<p>Players in Galactic Emperor: Hegemony take control of their destiny through a 2-D Java-based graphical interface. By careful allocation of resources, brilliant tactics, and a little luck any Overlord can assure himself of galactic domination. &quot;Hegemony is a totally different sort of game for Skotos,&quot; says Christopher Allen, Skotos Tech President &amp; CEO. &quot;It's about strategy and proving yourself the best tactical thinker.&quot;</p>
						<p>&quot;It's more than just a wargame, though,&quot; says Shannon Appelcline, Skotos Vice President, and the integrator of Hegemony into the Skotos community. &quot;The game centers on interacting with other players. Each player must engage in diplomacy and carefully balance their allies and their enemies. It's the only way a would-be Hegemon can hope to win &#151; and also what makes Hegemony a great match for our existing community of game.&quot; Galactic Emperor: Hegemony joins two successful social games in the Skotos community &#151; Skotos' own Castle Marrach and Worlds Apart's The Eternal City.</p>
						<p>The graphical strategic display of Hegemony will soon be complemented with &quot;Abode&quot;, a prose-based Chat Theatre. &quot;It will give players an opportunity to roleplay their Overlords using the existing Skotos game systems &#151; to strategize with their friends and taunt their enemies,&quot; says Shannon Appelcline. &quot;Roleplaying will be optional, though &#151; Overlords can play their game entirely in the strategic arena if they prefer.&quot;</p>
						<p>Galactic Emperor: Hegemony was previously released by Richard Wolfe as Space Empires, which has been running on the Internet since the Fall of 1999; in that time it's proven itself a robust and continuing success, and has also developed a solid community of players. &quot;When we first saw it, we knew it was something really good,&quot; says Christopher Allen. &quot;It appeals to a variety of different players and manages to turn a simple, but elegant, game system into a complex strategy game. The game's different every time you play it.&quot;</p>
						<p>Now available for full release, Galactic Emperor: Hegemony can be found at <a href="../../games/hegemony.html" target="_top">http://www.skotos.net/games/hegemony/</a>. A free 30-day trial gives new players the opportunity to try Hegemony out before making a commitment to the Skotos community.</p>
