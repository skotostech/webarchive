					<h2>Skotos Game Channel Adds Z-Opolis--the First Family-Friendly MMOG--to Their Lineup</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, August 17, 2004</b> &#151; Gamers looking for variety in online prose role-playing, graphical
role-playing, and strategy gaming, all for one single, affordable,
monthly subscription have already discovered Skotos. The one-stop game
channel destination for those where socializing, imaginative
story-telling by the players themselves, and the use of a little
brain-power are highest on the list of wants in the games they
play. It is these elements that are at the core of Z-Opolis, the
latest addition to the Skotos portfolio of games. With its
family-friendly, ESRB E-Rated game play that replaces weapons, combat,
and conflict with cool clothes, positive social interaction, and
cooperation, Z-Opolis is the first Massively Multiplayer Online Game
(MMOG) designed with true family appeal.

<p>"We see Z-Opolis as very complimentary to the games that Skotos
already offers," said Kevin Hannah, Vice President of Marketing
Officer at PersistentWorldZ. "Especially as Z-Opolis appeals strongly
to women of all ages as well as more casual game players."

<p>Z-Opolis is a virtual world where dreams and reality overlap. One
in which a player develops their Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and Social
Quotient (SQ), as well as their proficiency at any of the 6 different
types of job they can take: Gatherer, Hunter, Miner, Chef, Designer,
Engineer or Trader. Mix this with raising their very own interactive
Z-Pet, playing mini-games, creating and running their own club,
decorating their room, and wearing vibrant clothes and costumes, and
you have the perfect setting to make and play with friends.

<p>"PersistentWorldZ joins the Skotos' Associate Game program
alongside developers such as 4 Point Games, Near Death Studios, and
Lyra Studios" said Shannon Appelcline, Vice President at
Skotos. "Allowing us to offer a one-stop destination for any gamer
looking to play a diverse group of games for the same cost as it
usually takes to play just one game."
