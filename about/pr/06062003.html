						<h2>Skotos Adds Queen's Necklace to Strategy Channel</h2>
						<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, June 6, 2003</b> &#151; Skotos Tech, an online gaming channel, has added Queen's Necklace, a new tabletop strategy game, to its collection of multiplayer games. Queen's Necklace is the ninth game to join Skotos' online community, where a variety of strategy and roleplaying games are available for a single subscription price.<br>
							<br>
							Queen's Necklace is a strategy game set in France before the Revolution. Players take on the roles of jewelers; they must collect gems and use them to produce the finest jewelery, while at the same time trying to maintain the rarity of their chosen gems and to abide by the fashion decrees of the court. In addition they must balance this with maintaining the favor of crucial members of the court, from the king and queen, to forgers and thieves. The game takes just 30-45 minutes to play.<br>
							<br>
							Queen's Necklace is also the newest web game from Days of Wonder. &quot;They're producing high-quality board and card games, mostly based on European designs,&quot; says Shannon Appelcline, Vice President of Business Development at Skotos. &quot;Besides producing tabletop versions with beautiful components, they've also been maintaining a strong online presence. Their web site includes PDF rules, forums, and online versions of many of their games. Queen's Necklace is the second game that they've brought to the Skotos community.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Four strategy games are now part of the Skotos gaming channel, including Queen's Necklace and Days of Wonder's other Skotos community game, Gang of Four--an online version of the fast-playing card game. Skotos's strategic offerings also include Space Federation, a continuing game of resource management and planetary development, and Galactic Emperor: Hegemony, a game of space warfare that resets every three weeks. &quot;We've worked very hard to bring only the highest quality games to the Skotos community,&quot; says Shannon Appelcline. &quot;In addition, we've made sure that everything is integrated very tightly, so that the players can move from one game to another easily, without any fuss.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Besides the strategy games, Skotos Tech's gaming channel also includes five roleplaying games, including prose favorites such as The Eternal City and graphical classics such as Meridian 59. All nine games are available for free, trial play at <a href="../../storybuilders/Intro.shtml.html" target="_top">http://www.skotos.net</a>.<br>
