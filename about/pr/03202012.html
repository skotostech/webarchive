<h2>Skotos Enters Michael Schacht's Web of Power</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, March 20, 2012&#151; Skotos Tech today released its
sixth iPhone game, <a
href="http://www.tinyurl.com/mswebpowerduel">Michael Schacht's Web of
Power Card Game: The Duel</a>. Previously published as Richelieu, The
Duel has now returned to its intended Medieval theming.

<p>In Schacht's Web of Power games you battle opponents across a
landscape of 12th century Europe, trying to influence the great powers
that rule the Dark Ages. The Duel depicts that conflict using a set of
tiles that players will claim over the course of a game. By tactically
placing ownership markers and taking tiles, you will achieve the
majority control required to influence the countries and powers of
Europe.

<p>With its two-part turns interweaving the taking of tiles and planning
for the future, The Duel may be Skotos' most strategic game to
date. Hand-in-hand with that goes one of Skotos' most complex
artificial intelligence (AI) designs. Four different AI with four
different personalities challenge players at a variety of difficulty
levels.

<p>Designer Michael Schacht is a major German game designer who has been
creating tabletop games for almost two decades. His set-collection
game, Coloretto, is one of the best-known "euro" card games while its
sequel, Zooloretto, won the prestigious Game of the Year Award in
Germany. Both games are available in the United States through Rio
Grande Games.

<p>Skotos has adapted The Duel to the iPhone using its well-tested
MobileEuroCard platform for the iPhone and the iPad. Standardized
gestures, animations, and audio are all built into the platform,
making it easy for players of one of Skotos' card games to pick up and
play another. Previous games have included <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/msgold">Michael Schacht's Gold!</a> and
four different games by Reiner Knizia, including the best-selling
<a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkmoney">Money</a>.

<p>Each new game has offered expansions and improvements to the
MobileEuroCard library, and as a result The Duel is built atop two
years worth of development, making it Skotos' most attractive and
mature game to date. Like all of Skotos' MobileEuroCard games, The
Duel has been released as a universal app, so that players can
purchase it once and play it on any of their iPad, iPod, or iPhone
devices.
