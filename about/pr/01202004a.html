					<h2>Fist of Dragonstones Joins Skotos</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, January 20, 2004</b> &#151; Fist of Dragonstones, a
tabletop strategy game, has joined the Skotos Tech online gaming
channel as its eleventh multiplayer offering. Here it joins a
collection of roleplaying and strategy games, all available for one
low monthly fee.</p>

<p>Fist of Dragonstones is a new "designer game", by Bruno Faidutti
and Michael Schacht. It joins the ranks of board and card games that
have been revolutionizing the genre for the last ten years, including
standouts such as The Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, and Bohnanza.</p>

<p>In Fist of Dragonstones you negotiate for the services of a wide
array of fantasy characters&#151;including witches, thieves, ghosts,
necromancers, and the fabled dragons&#151;through a simple closed-fist
auction system. Slowly, you will gather the magical dragonstones, then
convert those to victory.</p>

<p>Fist of Dragonstones is also one of a growing line of high-quality
games from Days of Wonder. "They're producing high-quality board and
card games, based on the best American and European designs," says
Shannon Appelcline, Vice President of Business Development at
Skotos. "Besides publishing tabletop versions with beautiful
components, they've also been maintaining a strong online
presence. Their web site includes PDF rules, forums, and online
versions of many of their games. Fist of Dragonstones is the third
game that they've brought to the Skotos community."</p>

<p>Six strategy games are now part of the Skotos gaming channel,
including two other Days of Wonder designs, Queen's Necklace and Gang
of Four. Skotos's strategic offerings also include DroidArena, a game
of robotic combat, Space Federation, a continuing game of resource
management and planetary development, and Galactic Emperor: Hegemony,
a game of space warfare that resets every three weeks.</p>

<p>Besides the strategy games, Skotos Tech's gaming channel also
includes five roleplaying games, including prose favorites such as The
Eternal City and graphical classics such as Meridian 59. All eleven
games are available for free, trial play at <a
