<h2>Skotos Brings Reiner Knizia's Money to the iPad</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, April 2, 2010&#151;Skotos Tech has extended its
successful iPhone gaming app, Reiner Knizia's Money, by producing a
new iPad conversion which will become available this Saturday, April
3.

<p>This new iteration of Reiner Knizia's Money makes use of the iPad's
bigger screen to produce a better gaming experience. The app's gaming
table is larger and the cards are higher resolution. New sidebars
provide for easy access to buttons without covering up the gaming
table. The game now runs in any orientation, allowing you to always
pick up your iPad and play immediately. However, the biggest change is
that the larger iPad screen has allowed for the addition of a fifth
player to the game.

<p>"This reflects our continued support for mobile eurogames," says
developer Shannon Appelcline. "In optimizing Money for the iPad, we've
extended our core gaming engine, which means that all of our future
games will enjoy these same advantages." Work has already begun on
Skotos' next two mobile eurogames, Reiner Knizia's High Society and
Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms. In addition, talks are underway with other
tabletop designers to bring their games to the iPhone.

<p>Current players of Reiner Knizia's Money should find a free upgrade
available which will allow for play on the iPad as soon as it
arrives. New gamers who are interested in buying <a
