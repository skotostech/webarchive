						<h2>New Season of Droidarena Available at Skotos</h2>
						<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, August 8, 2003</b> &#151; Droidarena 2, the popular online strategy game, is now available for play as part of the Skotos Online Gaming Channel. It is the tenth game that has joined the Skotos community of online games.
<p>In the future world of Droidarena, the pent-up aggressions of an entire people are spent upon the newest sanitized blood sport: robot fighting. Fifteen different droids &#151; including Behemoths, Cyberspiders, Dragonflys, and Walkers &#151; combat under the control of highly skilled Deckers; it is the newest opiate of the masses. The fates of entire cities depend upon the results of arena combat &#151; and in the shadows ancient corporations are once again rising ...
<p>The players of Droidarena take on the roles of the Deckers in this strategic game of mechanized combat. They will spy upon their enemies, build up their bases, construct their own robots, and eventually determine their arena strategies. Through RSL &#151; a simple, event-driven robot-scripting language &#151; Deckers can program their creations with a variety of aggressive or subtle behaviors. It is only through careful construction and programming that Deckers can achieve victory at the international level.
<p>
Like most sports, Droidarena runs in seasons. The newest season of Droidarena began play on August 4, coinciding with its release at Skotos, and will last for two months.
