<h2>Skotos Tech Expands iPhone Store with Reiner Knizia's High Society</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, July 13, 2010&#151;Skotos Tech today released its
second iPhone game, Reiner Knizia's High Society, under its RPGnet
gaming label. This new game adapts High Society, one of Knizia's
best-known auction games and a member of his original auction trilogy.

<p>The iPhone release faithfully replicates the gameplay of the
original High Society tabletop game on the iOS platform. Players take
the role of members of the elite, bidding for luxuries such as
mansions, castles, and statuary. But, they must also watch out for
thieves and other disasters, and they can't end up with the least
money or they lose automatically. (The elite are fickle!)

<p>The game comes complete with an iPad adaptation that allows for a
richer playing experience on Apple's larger tablet device. Improved
graphics, more players, and extra information all add to the High
Society experience.

<p>High Society was produced by Christopher Allen and developed by
Shannon Appelcline, the co-authors of the popular programming book,
iPhone in Action, whose second edition will be out soon.  Shannon is
also a frequent writer about board games--a regular contributor to
both the online site BoardGameNews.com and the now-defunct magazine,
Knucklebones. "It's been great combining all of my board game know-how
with my programming skill over the last year," says Appelcline.

<p>High Society is Skotos Tech's second Knizia release, following the
well-received adaptation of Reiner Knizia's Money, which came out at
the start of the year. Both games use Skotos' MobileEuroCard gaming
platform, which allows players to use the same interface that they're
familiar with from previous games and which allows Skotos to share
technological advances across all their games. Six more MobileEuroCard
games are already in development, with Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms,
Reiner Knizia's Modern Art: The Card Game, and two works by other
authors all scheduled before the end of the year.
