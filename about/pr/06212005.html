<h2>Skotos Releases Castle Marrach Comic</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, June 21, 2005</b> &#151; Skotos Tech has released
the first issue of their Castle Marrach comic, Awakenings. This
fantasy comic written by Shannon Appelcline and illustrated by Bob
Cram, Jr., is available for free viewing online or for download at <a
href="../../games/marrach/comic/awakenings.html" target="_blank">http://awakenings.marrach.net/</a>.

<p><i>Castle Marrach: Awakenings</i> is set in the world of Skotos'
Castle Marrach online game. In another place, in another time, there
stands a castle atop an ancient mountain. It is a castle of fantasy
built atop a mountain of dreams. It is an empty castle, full of vacant
passages and cavernous rooms. It is a castle beginning to
awake. Awakenings tells the story of the brutish Victory Savary, his
rebirth into the Castle, and what he finds there.

<p>The Awakenings comic has been released under a non-commercial
Creative Commons license, which gives other creators on the Internet
the right to revise, adapt, modify, and republish the story as they
see fit--which could be as simple as colorizing the illustrations,
translating the comic to other languages, or adapting it into other
mediums, such as creating an animated short or a radio play.

<p>"Castle Marrach has always been about stories," says author Shannon
Appelcline. "The castle is full of storytellers living through their
own tales. My story, told in this comic, is ultimately based upon the
stories told by hundreds of others who came before me. That's how tall
tales, faerie tales, and other sorts of folk lore work. Thus, by
releasing this comic to the Creative Commons we're continuing a
tradition that lives on in the online Castle Marrach and that dates
back thousands of years."

<p>The game of Castle Marrach was launched in 2000 and for five years
players have wandered through the prose fantasy setting, roleplaying
unique characters and telling their own stories. The game is available
at <a href="../../games/marrach.html" target="_blank">http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach</a>.
