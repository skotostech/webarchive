					<h2>DroidArena Enters Third Generation<h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, January 20, 2004</b> &#151; DroidArena, one of the
eleven games available through the Skotos Online Gaming Channel, has
released a dramatically updated version of its software with the
opening of its newest season, this January.</p>

<p>"Almost everything has changed", says Don Weber of
DroidArena. Innovations in DroidArena 3: The Renaissance include:
improved User Interfaces, such as an icon-driven menu bar; vastly
expanded and branching research possibilities; the introduction of
devices to modify equipment capabilities; a reworked base building
system; a corp armory, and more. "We have plans for plenty of twists,
turns, new gizmos and new things to do," says Don Weber, promising
that the best is yet to come.</p>

<p>In the future world of DroidArena, the pent-up aggressions of an
entire people are spent upon the newest sanitized blood sport: robot
fighting. A variety of different droids&#151;including Behemoths,
Cyberspiders, Dragonflys, and Walkers&#151;combat under the control of
highly skilled Deckers. The fates of entire cities depend upon the
results of arena combat&#151;and in the shadows ancient corporations
are once again rising ...</p>

<p>Like most sports, Droidarena runs in seasons. The fist season of
DroidArena 3 began play this January and remains open for new players.</p>

<p>The Skotos Online Gaming Channel offers access to a variety of games
for one monthly subscription price. DroidArena is one of six strategy
games available through Skotos. Others include: Galactic Emperor:
Hegemony, a science-fiction game of space conquest; Space Federation,
a science-fiction game of planetary colonization and exploitation; and
Gang of Four, Fist of Dragonstones, and Queen's Necklace, three
tabletop strategy games.</p>
