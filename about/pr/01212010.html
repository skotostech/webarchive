<h2>Skotos Tech Launches iPhone Games with Reiner Knizia's Money</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, January 21, 2010&#151;Skotos Tech today launched its
first iPhone game, Reiner Knizia's Money, under its RPGnet gaming
label. The game adapts Money, one of Knizia's popular card-based
eurogames and a past nominee for Germany's prestigious Spiele des
Jahre (Game of the Year) award.

<p>The iPhone release faithfully replicates the gameplay of the
original Money tabletop game on the iPhoneOS platform. Players act as
currency exchangers, bidding money to win new money in auctions. When
doing so, they must also narrow down the types of currency they're
collecting, because they earn the most points when they complete large
sets of the same type of cash.

<p>Money was produced by Christopher Allen and developed by Shannon
Appelcline, the coauthors of the popular programming book, iPhone in
Action, whose second edition is planned for release this
summer. Shannon is also a frequent writer about board games--a regular
contributor to both the defunct print magazine Knucklebones and the
online site BoardGameNews.com. "It was a great opportunity to combine
my iPhone expertise and my love of gaming," said Shannon. "I'm looking
forward to developing more!"

<p>Money is just the first Reiner Knizia title that Skotos is
producing. Reiner Knizia's High Society is already on deck as the
second game. It will use the same powerful mobile gaming platform that
Skotos Tech created for Money. This shared card game platform will
allow continued technological advancements to be shared across all of
Skotos' releases, including already-published and brand-new games
alike. High Society is scheduled for publication late in the second
quarter of 2010.
