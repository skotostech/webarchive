						<h2>HISTORICAL GOLDEN GATE: 1849 GAME ANNOUNCED</h2>
						<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, June 25, 1999</b> &#150; Skotos Tech today announced its second interactive fiction game, Golden Gate: 1849. Lisa Eichler, an amateur San Francisco historian and long-time designer and graphic artist, has been hired to develop this historical game.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;History is mostly undeveloped in the world of interactive fiction,&quot; said Lisa Eichler, &quot;despite the fact that it&#146;s been widely popular in other genres. Take a look at Age of Empires or Civilization&#151;two of the best-selling strategy games around. The players are there.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Golden Gate: 1849 portrays the city of San Francisco during the great California Gold Rush. It is a time of heroes and villains&#151;of fortunes lost and regained&#151;when San Francisco was the nexus of the Far West, a breeding ground for hope and greed in equal quantities. It presents the end of one way of life and the beginning of another when brave pioneers created a civilization from nothing on the shores of the Pacific Ocean.<br>
							<br>
							In Golden Gate: 1849 players take the roles of immigrants. Some will come to San Francisco seeking gold while others will be searching to find a new way of life&#151;or to escape an old one. As players arrive the city of San Francisco will slowly change and evolve. Historically researched events will occur on a daily basis. At first players will solely be concerned with survival, but they will ultimately compete for political and economic control of the City by the Bay.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;Golden Gate: 1849 really opens up a range of possibilities,&quot; said Lisa Eichler. &quot;We can create interactive fiction games set anytime anywhere. If we want to portray Pompeii&#146;s last day or the rise of Rome, we can do it. We can offer unique insights into history by simulating past events and allowing players to interact with them.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							As with Skotos&#146; other games, Golden Gate: 1849 is built upon the Skotos StoryBuilder Server, a powerful online game engine. It creates a virtual reality that is as much about socialization as competition. Thousands of social verbs and adverbs make meaningful interaction possible. StoryBuilding resources allow for the creation of clans and guilds; in-game discussions will be augmented by out-of-game interactions at web sites, chats, bulletin boards, and club houses.<br>
							<br>
							Lisa Eichler, the game designer responsible for Golden Gate: 1849, has participated in traditional pen-and-paper role-playing games for over twenty years. One of her most recent professional projects was the Miskatonic University Antarctic Expedition Pack, a supplement produced for Chaosium Inc. This collection of newspaper articles, postcards, and other props immersed readers in the world of the Eastern United States in 1933.<br>
							<br>
							The initial Golden Gate: 1849 game is to be released in Late 2000 as a Grand Theatre.</p>
