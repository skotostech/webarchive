<h2>Skotos Partners with Game Table Online</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, May 11, 2006</b> &#151; 
Skotos Tech has partnered
with GameTable Online to make five of GTO's online board, card, and
dice games available through the Skotos gaming channel. GTO games now
available at Skotos are Cosmic Wimpout, Igel Argern, Kill Doctor
Lucky, Nuclear War, and Reiner Knizia's Vampire.

<p>The new GTO games cover the spectrum of tabletop play. Cosmic
Wimpout and Nuclear War are both American classics, while Kill Doctor
Lucky is by modern American designer James Ernest. Igel Argern and
Vampire conversely are strong European designs by popular German
designers Frank Nestel and Reiner Knizia. The games all support
multiplayer Internet play, and are regularly featured in online
tournaments. In addition, Cosmic Wimpout, Igel Argern, and Nuclear War
also feature solitaire play options.

<p>GameTable Online's games join Skotos' wide-ranging gaming channel,
which now offers 18 different games for one monthly price. Besides
Skotos' popular role-playing games, the Skotos gaming channel also
features a connection of strategy games, ranging in playtime from
fifteen minutes to many months. Other tabletop strategy games
currently offered through Skotos include Alan R. Moon's Ticket to Ride
and Ticket to Ride Europe, Bruno Faidutti's Fist of Dragonstones and
Queen's Necklace, and the Asian card game, Gang of Four.

<p>The Skotos games are available for a month of no-obligation trial
play at <a href="../../storybuilders/Intro.shtml.html">http://www.skotos.net</a>.
