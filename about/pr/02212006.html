<h2>Skotos Publishes Two New Gaming Columns</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, February 21, 2006</b> &#151; Skotos Tech,
long-time publisher of online gaming articles, this month added two
new columns to its regular rotation: <i>Perspectives</i>, by Sam Liu,
and
<i>Lessons from the Live Team</i>, by Sandra Powers. These and other
columns are all available at <a
href="../../articles.html">http://www.skotos.net/articles</a>.

<p><i>Perspectives</i> is written from the point-of-view of a web game
designer. It looks at why some games work and others don't. The first
column, "Game Developers Flourish", studies the developer-to-gamer
ratio in the world of the web.

<p><i>Lessons from the Live Team</i> covers the post-release world of
MMORPGs, and is written by a member of the live team from <i>Asheron's
Call 1</i>. The first column, "The Message", introduces the concept of
live teams, and how most of the development of a modern MMORPG comes
after the release, not before.

<p>These new columns join other currently running series, including
Shannon Appelcline's <i>Trials, Triumphs & Trivialities</i>, Scott
Holliday's <i>Storms on Cloud 9</i>, and Heather Logas' <i>Pleasures
of the Flesh</i>. Each column covers the topic of online game design
from different perspectives. The Skotos Articles Archive also includes
hundreds of additional articles on designing, developing,
administering, and playing online games, with past authors including
Richard Bartle, Jessica Mulligan, and Dave Rickey.

<p>Skotos is continuing to search for new volunteers interested in
sharing their experiences about any aspects of online gaming, from
playing them to creating them. If you'd like to write a one-off
article, or an ongoing series, email editor Shannon Appelcline at <a
href="mailto:shannona@skotos.net">shannona@skotos.net</a>.
