<h2>RPGnet Gaming Index Passes 10,000</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, May 13, 2008</b> &#151; This month the RPGnet
Gaming Index, already the largest listing of roleplaying games and
magazines on the internet, surpassed 10,000 unique games and magazines
in its listings.

<p><a href="http://index.rpg.net">RPGnet's online gaming index</a> is
a single source that details the entire roleplaying hobby. As of today
it contains over 8,800 games and supplements, over 1,200 fully
detailed magazines, and an additional 1,200 editions, for a total of
11,200 unique items.  Each page on the RPGnet Gaming Index includes
not only a full description of the item and a cover image, but also
cross-linked details which allow quick lookups of other products by
the same authors, set in the same settings, or using the same rules.

<p>The magazine entries are some of the most unique and informative in
the index since they provide full content listings that are
cross-linked in to the rest of the index. Among the highlights are a
complete listing of <i>Knights of the Dinner Table Magazine</i>, a
listing of the first 100 issues of <i>White Dwarf</i> magazine, a near
complete listing of <i>The Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society</i>,
and a listing of 335 issues of <i>Dragon Magazine</i>, over 90% of its
long run. Newer magazines like <i>Kobold Quarterly</i> and
<i>Polymancer</i> are also represented.

<p>The index is more than just a static information source. Users can
mark ownership and rate each item in the RPGnet Gaming
Index. Currently there are 21,500 individual ratings and 3,500 full
reviews contained in the Index, ranking its entire collection of RPGs,
beginning with <i>Delta Green: Countdown</I> (#1), <i>Delta Green</I>
(#2), and <i>Spirit of the Century</i> (#3).

<p>The RPGnet Gaming Index is freely available for reference and can also
be edited by all users. Entering ownership and rating information
requires free registration with the <a
href="http://forum.rpg.net">RPGnet Forums</a>.
