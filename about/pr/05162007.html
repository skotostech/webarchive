<h2>Skotos & RPGnet Launch New Forums</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, May 16, 2007</b> &#151; RPGnet--and parent company
Skotos Tech--has launched three new forums, adding d20 and LARPs to
RPGnet and creating the brand-new Xenagia forum for fantasy,
science-fiction, and horror discussions.

<p><a href="http://www.xenagia.net">Xenagia</a> is Skotos' biggest
release. This is an entirely new site dedicated to fantasy,
science-fiction, and horror, all built on the same community software
successfully used to run RPGnet.

<p>The heart of Xenagia is a <a
href="http://forum.xenagia.net">forum</a> dedicated to all mediums for
fantasy, science-fiction, and horror, including TV, movies, and
books. Also available at Xenagia is a <a
href="http://index.xenagia.net">book index</a>, which currently
contains info and ratings on over 500 fantasy, science-fiction, and
horror books, and which is growing every day. Reviews, columns, press
listings, store locators, and other features will all be added to
Xenagia as the site grows.

<p>Meanwhile Skotos is also busy expanding its oldest community site,
RPGnet, the biggest independent roleplaying site on the 'net. RPGnet
has traditionally maintained a vibrant forum which is one of the few
hundred largest on the net. In recent weeks it has expanded its
coverage with two new "spotlight" forums.

<p>The <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=89">d20
spotlight</a> covers all games built using Wizards of the Coast's d20
SRD. Besides hosting discussions of the world's most popular
roleplaying system, the new d20 spotlight also covers <i>Castles &
Crusades</i>, <i>Mutants & Masterminds</i>, and many other d20-related
games. To highlight the d20 material already available at RPGnet, a <a
href="http://d20.rpg.net">d20 home page</a> has also been unveiled.

<p>RPGnet's <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=70">LARP
forum</a> was kicked off a year ago, but has recently been raised to
spotlight status, making it more available to RPGnet's forum
readers. The LARP forum allows discussions of all types of LARPing,
from boffers to the Masquerade.
