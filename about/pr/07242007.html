<h2>RPGnet Gaming Index Grows to Over 8000</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, July 24, 2007</b> &#151; The RPGnet Gaming Index,
already the largest index of roleplaying games and supplements on the
Internet, has now grown to over 8,000 entries.

<p><a href="http://index.rpg.net">RPGnet's online gaming index</a> is
a single source that details the entire roleplaying hobby. As of today
it contains over 6,700 games and supplements, over 700 fully detailed
magazines, and an additional 850 editions, for a total of 8,250 unique
items.

<p>Each page on the RPGnet Gaming Index includes not only a full
description of the item and a cover image, but also cross-linked
details which allow quick lookups for other products by the same
authors, set in the same settings, or using the same rules.

<p>Users can also mark ownership and rate each item in the RPGnet
Gaming Index. Currently there are 16,450 individual ratings and 2,900
full reviews contained in the Index, ranking its entire collection of
RPGs, beginning with <i>Delta Green</I> (#1), <i>Delta Green:
Countdown</I> (#2), and <i>Unknown Armies</i> (#3).

<p>New features, such as the recent industry award listing and the
brand-new publisher, system, and setting information pages are
constantly being added.

<p>The RPGnet Gaming Index is freely available for reference and can
also be edited by all users. Entering ownership and rating information
requires free registration with the <a
