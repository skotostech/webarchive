<h2>Michael Schacht's Gold! Simultaneously Released for iPhone and Tabletop Play</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, February 3, 2011&#151; Skotos Tech today released its
newest iPhone game, <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/msgold">Michael
Schacht's Gold!</a>, simultaneous to the publication of the tabletop
game by Abacus Spiele. This first-ever co-release of a mass-market
game for both the iPhone and traditional media marks a real milestone
in the growth of mobile gaming.

<p>The designer, Michael Schacht, is a major German game designer who
has been creating tabletop games for almost two decades. His
set-collection game, Coloretto, is one of the best-known "euro" card
games, while its sequel, Zooloretto, won the prestigious Game of the
Year Award in Germany. Both games are available in the United States
through Rio Grande Games.

<p>Schacht's newest game, Gold!, promises to follow in the footsteps
of those past successes. Much like Coloretto, it's a very clever game
of set-collection where cards are taken from a common pool. However,
the entirely-original Gold! offers more opportunity for tactical
finesse; cards can be both taken from the pool and exchanged, giving
players numerous opportunities to collect together trios of
high-valued, matching cards.

<p>Skotos has adapted Gold! to the iPhone using its well-tested
MobileEuroCard platform for the iPhone and the iPad. Standardized
gestures, animations, and audio are all built into the platform,
making it easy for players of one of Skotos' card games to pick up and
play another. To date, three other games have been programmed on the
platform: <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkmoney">Reiner Knizia's
Money</a>, <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkhighsociety">Reiner
Knizia's High Society</a>, and <a
href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkkingdoms">Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms</a>.

<p>Each new game has offered expansions and improvements to the
MobileEuroCard library, and as a result Gold! is built atop a
year-and-a-half worth of development, making it Skotos' most
attractive and mature game to date. Like all of Skotos' MobileEuroCard
games, Gold! has been released as a universal app, so that players can
purchase it once and play it on any of their iPad, iPod, or iPhone
devices.
