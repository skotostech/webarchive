<h2>Lovecraft Country Online Goes Beta</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, June 29, 2005</b> &#151; Country: Arkham by Night,
the online game of Cthulhoid horror, has been released in an open beta
by Skotos Tech, and is now available for play at <a
href="http://www.lovecraftcountry.com"
target="_blank">Lovecraftcountry.com</a>.

<p>Lovecraft Country is an online prose roleplaying game, open 24x7,
that allows players to become students at Miskatonic University in
1935 and explore the mysterious witch-town of Arkham. Strange dreams,
blasphemous magics, clawing insanities, and forbidden tomes are just
some of the things you'll find within, all simulated by fully featured
game systems. Arkham is also populated with numerous,
highly-interactive computer characters who can provide hints about
ongoing stories and larger plots that are guided by the game staff. In
addition, the setting is well-suited as a stage for players to tell
their own stories.

<p>"We're very excited to be opening the doors to our beta test," said
Todd Nilson, the game's lead designer.  "What we offer here is a
unique opportunity to participate in a living narrative that attempts
to recreate the atmosphere and visceral feel of Lovecraft's fiction.
We hope that it will be a draw to role-playing enthusiasts, Lovecraft
fans, and 1930s buffs as well."

<p>The setting of Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night is based on the
popular series of supplements produced by Chaosium, detailing the
cities of H.P. Lovecraft's Miskatonic Valley. Chaosium's book are, in
turn, based directly on the works of Lovecraft himself.

<p>More info on Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night may be found at <a
href="http://www.lovecraftcountry.com"

major event, an Alice in Wonderland themed party, is planned for this
Saturday at 9pm ET.
