<h2>Reiner Knizia's Modern Art: The Card Game is Skotos Tech's Newest Work</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, May 24, 2011&#151; Skotos Tech today released <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkmodernartcg">Modern
Art: The Card Game</a>, its fourth iPhone and iPad game by Reiner
Knizia. It's a game of card management and market manipulation that
builds on one of Knizia's best-loved gaming franchises.

<p>Modern Art: The Card Game puts gamers in the role of art
speculators trying to sell their artistic purchases for the best
prices possible. Though selling artwork helps to drive the market,
players will also want to hold on to pieces for sale in later rounds
when they're move valuable. This dilemma between selling and
stockpiling is a central focus in the game.

<p>Reiner Knizia is one of the top designers in the "eurogame"
movement. He's also created auction games, like High Society and
Money, and tile-placement games, like Kingdoms--all of which are
available from Skotos as iPhone games.

<p>Modern Art: The Card Game is built upon Skotos' well-tested
MobileEuroCard platform for the iPhone and the iPad, which
incorporates almost two years' worth of developmental
work. Standardized gestures, animations, and audio are all built into
the platform, making it easy for players of one of Skotos' card games
to pick up and play another. Besides its quartet of Knizia games,
Skotos Tech has also released Michael Schacht's Gold! on the
MobileEuroCqrd platform, highlighting the newest work of another top
eurogame designer.
