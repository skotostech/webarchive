<h2>Skotos Eurogames Enter the Game Center</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, June 26, 2012&#151; Skotos today updated their
popular iOS game, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/rkmoney">Reiner Knizia's
Money</a>, to make the game more competitive and to offer support for
Apple's Game Center.

<p>The changes kick off with a new "Elo Rating" system, based on the
ranking system used by the US Chess Federation and other gaming
organizations. These Elo ratings allow players to better assess the
skills as compared to the various AIs available for play in
<i>Money</i> and also make each gaming victory or loss meaningful.

<p>In addition, Skotos' new Elo Ratings link through Money to Apple's
Game Center. Players can thus compare both their top scores <i>and</I>
their top Elo Ratings with players across the world, using Game Center
Leaderboards. Pop-up rankings constantly alert players to their
current standings and help to make this into a true international
competition!

<p>Because all six of Skotos's iOS card & tile games are built on the
same MobileEuroCard gaming platform, Elo and Game Center integration
will soon be released for the rest of Skotos' catalog. Reiner Knizia's
Kingdoms and Reiner Knizia's Modern Art: The Card Game are even now
being converted, with release expected for both in just a few weeks'
time.

<p>The 2.0 revision of Reiner Knizia's Money also includes a number of
other new features, among them: an improved rules book that is more
graphical and easier to follow; an option for opponents to bid in a
random order, giving players a little more information before they
take their own turn; and new highlighting of particularly valuable
bids.
