<h2>Trident Games Prepares New Online Game Using Skotos Engine</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, March 2, 2007 -</b> Skotos Tech, a producer of
online games, has licensed its innovative StoryBuilder Kit to Trident
Games, who will be producing a new prose roleplaying game with it
called <i>Citadel: Lands of the Empty Sky</i>.

<p>Skotos has been developing the StoryBuilder Kit since 1999 to allow
for the vivid creation of prose multiuser environments. It is built on
DGD, which was also used by iChat to create its original chat
server. At Skotos the StoryBuilder Kit is now the heart of four
different online games, <i>Castle Marrach</i>, <i>Ironclaw Online</i>,
<i>The Lazarus Project</i>, and <i>Lovecraft Country: Arkham by
Night</i>. <i>Citadel</i> will be the first licensed game built using
Skotos' gaming engine.

<p>In the World of Citadel it has been three hundred years since the
stars fell from the sky as crystal fragments, shaking the very laws of
reality and reducing the world of Citadel to barbarism. Seven nations
have now grown amidst the indecipherable relics of the past; they vie
to shape a new world.

<p><i>Citadel: Lands of the Empty Sky</i> will feature an immersive
blend of directed adventure and open content.  Players will experience
tactical combat through the eyes of eight distinct classes, fighting
either solo or in groups. Citadel's crafting, business, housing,
politics, and PvP warfare systems will supplement this core combat
system, providing endless opportunity for ongoing play.

<p><i>Citadel</i> is currently in development.

<p>The Skotos StoryBuilder Kit, including both the DGD driver and
Skotos' prose roleplaying library, is available for license for online
games. Additional information is available by mailing
storybuilder-sales@skotos.net.
