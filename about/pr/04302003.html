						<h2>Skotos Tech Launches Partnership With Gamer.tv</h2>
						<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, April 30, 2003 &#151;</b> Skotos Tech, creator and publisher of multiplayer games, has launched a partnership with Gamer.tv (<a href="http://www.gamer.tv" target="_blank">www.gamer.tv</a>), leading producer of television and online computer games coverage. Through this relationship hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Gamer.tv online site will be given the opportunity to try out Skotos' entire channel of high-quality online games.<br>
							<br>
							Gamer.tv's web site is a preeminent gaming resource that combines a mixture of diverse content, from cutting-edge browser games and community tools to exclusive video-on-demand features. Skotos Tech's games are now available as a part of this gaming site; an integrated signup system allows players to easily create and maintain their Skotos accounts from within Gamer.tv.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;This is a direct outgrowth of our new Associate Game program,&quot; says Shannon Appelcline, Vice President of Business Development at Skotos. &quot;We were able to offer Gamer.tv a package of seven games, with more to come, and that made a partnership very exciting for them.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Through Skotos Tech's Associate Game program, high-quality online games can become part of the Skotos community on a non-exclusive basis. This allows games to bring in new players by taking advantage of Skotos' marketing, branding, and business development. By becoming a member of a community of online games, each game gains more clout than it would have individually, allowing for new distribution deals, such as this one with Gamer.tv.<br>
							<br>
							Skotos, currently a channel of seven graphical roleplaying, prose roleplaying, and strategy games, continues to look for both additional Associates and for portals and ISPs who wish to partner with a channel of online games. Interested parties should mail Shannon Appelcline at <a href="mailto:ShannonA@skotos.net">shannona@skotos.net</a>.<br>
