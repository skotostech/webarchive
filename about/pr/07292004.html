					<h2>Lovecraft Country to Premiere at GenCon Indy 2004</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, July 29, 2004</b> &#151; Skotos Tech will release
the public beta of Lovecraft Country: Arkham By Night at this year's
GenCon celebration in Indianapolis, August 19-22, 2004.

<p>Many of the builders from the Skotos team of Lovecraft Country will
be present to talk about the game and take e-mails for the Beta test.
Information about the game will be available at the Skoto Tech trade
show booth #1541.

<p>The game&#8217;s beta release will begin shortly after the Gen Con
event and will run for approximately one to two months, after which
time the game will go into regular release.&nbsp; Those interested in
participating in the beta test will have the opportunity to sign up at
Gen Con and have a chance to win t-shirts and tote bags with the
Lovecraft Country logo imprint.

<p>Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night is based on the popular series
of supplements produced by Chaosium, detailing the cities of
H.P. Lovecraft&#8217;s Miskatonic Valley. Chaosium&#8217;s book are,
in turn, based directly on the works of Lovecraft himself. Classic
Lovecraft stories, such as &#8220;The Call of Cthulhu&#8221;,
&#8220;The Dunwich Horror&#8221;, and &#8220;The Dream-Quest of
Unknown Kadath&#8221;, have influenced entire generations of horror
writers, including best-sellers Robert Bloch, Ramsey Campbell, and
Stephen King. Many classic horror movies, including Alien, Reanimator,
and The Thing are also Lovecraft&#8217;s heirs.

<p>Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night is a member of the Skotos Tech
community of online games. It builds upon the strong social systems
already proven in Skotos Tech&#8217;s Castle Marrach, a game of online
storytelling and roleplaying that has been active for over three
years.
