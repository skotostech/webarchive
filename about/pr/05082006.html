<h2>RPGnet Forums Go Live (Action)</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, May 8, 2006</b> &#151; Following shortly on the heels of its recent, successful launch of an Actual Play forum, RPGnet has again extended its roleplaying discussion area, this time by creating a new LARP forum at <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=70">forum.rpg.net</a>.

<p>RPGnet's new LARP forum provides a centralized location to discuss all sorts of Live Action Roleplaying games, from boffer play to Vampire: The Requiem LARPs. Though the forum is newly created, there are already over a dozen active threads, covering the gaming spectrum from fun LARP ideas to specific gamemastering suggestions, from live-action wish-lists to system-specific discussions of Exalted, Fading Suns, Nobilis, and Vampire LARPs.

<p>The RPGnet forums are already the most active indie roleplaying
forums on the 'net. With over 5.6 million threads and 8,500 unique
visitors viewing the forums every day, the RPGnet forums represent a
huge online gaming community.
