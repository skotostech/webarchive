						<h2>Gang of Four Joins Skotos Tech as Associate Game<br>
						</h2>
						<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, April 22, 2003</b> &#151; Gang of Four, an online game produced by Days of Wonder Inc., has joined Skotos Tech as an Associate Game. This marks the seventh game to become a member of Skotos, a gaming community which offers its players access to a multitude of online roleplaying and strategy games for a single subscription price.<br>
							<br>
							Gang of Four is a deceptively simple card game which originated in the Orient. Players attempt to empty their hands of cards by playing them in an ascending sequence. However, its strategy is fiendishly complex, requiring careful play to ensure a player of the ability to go out.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;It's a totally new type of game for Skotos,&quot; says Shannon Appelcline, Vice President of Skotos. &quot;Gang of Four is a game which can be played in just 30-45 minutes, and that offers very different dynamics from our multi-week strategy games and our ongoing roleplaying experiences.&quot; Though the first of its type, Skotos is making plans for additional short-duration strategy games, both with Days of Wonder and with other companies.<br>
							<br>
							The partnership between Skotos and Days of Wonder was accomplished through Skotos' new Associate Game program, where existing online games can agree to non-exclusive distribution with Skotos. Other members of the Associate Game program include Near Death Studios, the producers of Meridian 59, and Lyra Studios, the producers of Underlight.<br>
							<br>
							Skotos' Associate Games get to benefit from Skotos marketing, branding, and business development. They also become members of a game designer's community which jointly has more clout when talking with carriers and portals than any game would individually. A sophisticated royalty system ensures that each game shares user fees from every player proportionately.<br>
							<br>
							Skotos Tech is actively looking for more developers to become members of the Associate Game community. Developers interested in learning more about the Skotos Associate Game program should contact Shannon Appelcline directly at <a href="mailto:ShannonA@skotos.net">shannona@skotos.net</a>.<br>
