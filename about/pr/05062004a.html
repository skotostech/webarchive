					<h2>Gang of Four 2.0 Now Available at Skotos</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, May 6, 2004</b> &#151; of Four 2.0, the newest version of
Days of Wonder's most popular online strategy game, is now available
as part of Skotos Tech's online gaming channel.

<p>Gang of Four is a deceptively simple card game which originated in the
Orient. Players attempt to empty their hands of cards by playing them
in an ascending sequence. However, its strategy is fiendishly complex,
requiring careful play to ensure a player of the ability to go out.

<p>This major new release of Gang of Four introduces robot players to
the game. Though the game server is filled with potential human
opponents during peak hours, players will now have the additional
option to battle against computerized foes during down times. In
addition, robot players will automatically replace human opponents who
drop out of the game for any reason.

<p>"It resolves one of the few flaws in an otherwise great online card
game," says Shannon Appelcline, Vice President of
Skotos. Disconnecting players, due to bad networks, or just a bad
game, has been a problem since online games first appeared over two
decades ago. By introducing replacement robot players, Days of Wonders
has resolved one of the more notable problems in the online game
field.

<p>The partnership between Skotos and Days of Wonder was accomplished
through Skotos' Associate Game program, where existing online games
can agree to non-exclusive distribution with Skotos. Other members of
the Associate Game program include 4 Point Games, Near Death Studios,
and Lyra Studios.

<p>Gang of Four is one of six different strategy games available through
the Skotos gaming channel. Other Days of Wonder games available at
Skotos include Fist of Dragonstones and Queen's Necklace. Longer-term
Skotos strategy games include Droid Arena 3, Galactic Emperor:
Hegemony, and Space Federation. The Skotos games package is available
all for one low monthly fee.

<p>Players interested in trying out Skotos' eleven games should visit
<a href="../../storybuilders/Intro.shtml.html">http://www.skotos.net</a> for a free
trial month.
