						<h2>Download Online Games Affiliates with Skotos</h2>
						<b>BERKELEY, CA, August 8, 2003</b> &#151; Download Online Games, an up-and-coming gaming portal, has signed on with Skotos as an affiliate portal. Through this partnership, Download Online Games members will have the opportunity to try out Skotos games.
						<p>
"We've now got 10 games available on our gaming channel," says Shannon Appelcline, Vice President of Business Development at Skotos. "We're very pleased to work with portals like Download Online Games to help spread the word, and let people know about all the games they can be found in one place."

<p>Download Online Games is a Internet portal site which acts as a central directory for the numerous high-quality games found on the Internet. Screenshots and graphics help players get a real feel for the many games available, while cross-links help lead players to similar games they might like. The site catalogues both single player downloads and multiplayer games &#151; though the latter category is dominated by Skotos' offerings.
<p>
Skotos Tech offers the premier aggregate gaming channel on the Internet. It includes Castle Marrach, The Eternal City, and Grendel's Revenge, prose roleplaying games which give players the opportunity for in-depth social interaction; Meridian 59: Sacred Haven and Underlight, graphical roleplaying games which allow for a visual role-playing experience; Droid Arena 2, Galactic Emperor: Hegemony, and Space Federation, science fiction strategy games which run the gamut from robot combot to galactic conquest; and Queen's Necklace and Gang of Four, two tabletop strategy games.

<p>Skotos Tech continues to look for more associate game partners, who wish to publish their games with Skotos, and more affiliate site partners, who wish to help spread the word about Skotos. Parties interested in partnerships may mail <a href="mailto:ShannonA@skotos.net">shannona@skotos.net</a> for more information.
