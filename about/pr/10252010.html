<h2>Skotos Tech Offers Third iPhone Game: Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms</h2>

<p>BERKELEY, CA, October 25, 2010&#151; Skotos Tech has added <a
href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkkingdoms">Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms</a>
to its growing library of eurogames available for the iPhone, iPad,
and iPod Touch. This new tile-laying game gives players the
opportunity to build medieval realms.

<p>Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms is Skotos' most ambitious game to date. Each
turn you either further define the gameboard by playing a tile--which
could be a resource or a hazard-- or else you place a castle to try
and capture the most valuable lands. Over three rounds of play you
must make the best use of your castles to earn the highest score.

<p>Kingdoms features all-original art by fantasy artist & catographer
Keith Curtis. It was specifically designed for the iOS game, and thus
looks clean and sharp on iPhones, iPhone4s, and iPads alike.

<p>Unlike many iOS publishers, Skotos doesn't make you pay twice for your
games. Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms is shipped as a universal app, which
means you can play it on your iPhone, your iPod, and your iPad. The
iPad adaptation allows for a richer playing experience on Apple's
larger tablet device. Improved graphics and extra information both add
to the Kingdoms experience.

<p>Kingdoms is Skotos Tech's third Knizia release, following <a
href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkhighsociety">Reiner Knizia's High
Society</a> and <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/rkmoney">Reiner
Knizia's Money</a>, both published earlier in 2010.  All three games
use Skotos' MobileEuroCard gaming platform, which allows players to
use the same interface that they're familiar with from previous games
and which allows Skotos to share technological advances across all
their games. Five more MobileEuroCard games are already in
development, including Reiner Knizia's Modern Art: The Card Game, two
games by Michael Schacht, and two small-press games. All five games
are expected out by mid-2011.
