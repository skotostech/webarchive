<h2>Skotos Launches Ironclaw and Lazarus</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, January 3, 2007 </b> &#151; Skotos Tech, a publisher
of online games, this week launched two new prose roleplaying games,
Ironclaw Online and The Lazarus Project. These games are available for
play as part of the extensive Skotos gaming channel.

<p>Ironclaw Online is an anthropomorphic fantasy roleplaying game
based upon Sanguine Production's tabletop release. Many different
races, cultures, and societies are converging upon the waterfront city
of Triskellian. Though players must start from humble beginnings, they
will quickly become involved in the guilds and politics of the town.

<p>The Lazarus Project is a science-fiction roleplaying game by
designer Michael Zerbo that asks the question, "What is the price of
immortality?" Though mankind has reached the stars, the ultimate
achievement of conquering death still eludes them. As newly grown
citizens players must make a life for themselves in Alpha Colony.

<p>Ironclaw Online and the Lazarus Project are two of Skotos' "Skotos
Seven"--roleplaying games built by external developers using Skotos'
text-based gaming engine. They join Skotos' channel of 18 different
games, all available for one price. Other Skotos roleplaying games
include fantasy offerings <i>Castle Marrach</i>, <i>The Eternal
City</i>, and <i>Grendel's Revenge</i> and horror release <i>Lovecraft
Country</i>.

<p>The Skotos games are available for a month of free trial play at <a

information on The Lazarus Project can be found at <a
