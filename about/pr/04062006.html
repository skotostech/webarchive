<h2>RPGnet Forums Launch Actual Play</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, April 6, 2006</b> &#151; The RPGnet Forums this
week expanded their content by creating a new area for the discussion
of "actual play". This new subforum provides a place for players and
gamemasters alike to detail their real-life roleplaying
campaigns. RPGnet's Actual Play subforum can be found at <a
href="http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=68">forum.rpg.net</a>.

<p>Actual Play has been an increasingly active topic in the RPGnet
forums for some time. The new Actual Play subforum makes these
real-life game descriptions easier to find and keeps them from being
lost amidst the many other active topics being discussed at RPGnet.

<p>By incorporating existing threads into the new subforum, the Actual
Play area at RPGnet already includes over 200 threads and over 11,000
messages. Actual Play roleplaying threads updated since the creation
of the new forum earlier this week include campaign descriptions for
Adventure!, Artesia, Buffy, Cthulhu Dark Ages, d20 Doctor Who, D&D,
D&D: Eberron, Delta Green, Exalted, Orpheus, Paranoia, RIFTS,
Shadowrun, Sorcerer, Stormbringer, Tribe 8, Unknown Armies, and
Weapons of the Gods.

<p>The RPGnet forums are already the most active indie roleplaying
forums on the 'net. With over 5.5 million threads and 8,500 unique
visitors viewing the forums every day, the RPGnet forums represent a
huge online gaming community.
