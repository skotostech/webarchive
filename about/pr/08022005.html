<h2>Skotos Releases H.P. Lovecraft Comic</h2>

<p><b>BERKELEY, CA, August 2, 2005</b> &#151; Skotos Tech has released
a new Cthulhu Mythos comic, <i>Lovecraft Country: Return to
Arkham</i>. This moody black and white piece, available for free
download at <a
href="http://www.lovecraftcountry.com/comic" target="_blank">Skotos</a>, is by Shannon
Appelcline and illustrated by Saffronrage Solutions.

<p><i>Lovecraft Country: Return to Arkham</i> is set in and around
H.P. Lovecraft's Miskatonic University during the Summer of 1933. Seth
Fletcher has traveled to Arkham in search of his brother, gone missing
years before, and his explorations will lead him into some of Arkham's
strangest locales.

<p>"I consider it a sort of introduction to Arkham," says writer
Shannon Appelcline. "We visit many of its more prosaic locations,
including Miskatonic University, the Arkham Sanitarium, and one of the
several graveyards dotting the city. In the meantime we see an
interesting story unraveling, about not just the quest for a missing
sibling, but also an investigation into the nature of what is real."


<p>Skotos Tech's two Lovecraftian games, <i>The Tomb of the Desert
God</i> and <i>Arkham by Night</i>, form the background of <i>Return
to Arkham</i>.  Set in between these games, the comic details the
aftermath of Tomb's Moroccan expedition, but utilizes the
heavily-detailed urban setting of Arkham by Night, a setting
previously outlined by game company Chaosium in their
<i>H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham</i> supplement, and originally described by
H.P. Lovecraft himself in numerous stories.

<p><i>Return to Arkham</i> is Skotos' second comic book, following
their successful <a href="http://awakenings.marrach.net" target="_blank"><i>Castle
Marrach: Awakenings</i></a>, a fantasy comic set in a secluded
castle. Like Awakenings, <i>Return to Arkham</i> is being released
under a non-commercial Creative Commons license which gives other
creators on the Internet the right to revise, adapt, modify, and
republish the story as they see fit.

<p>"Lovecraft Country was what really got us thinking about the Creative
Commons in the first place," says Appelcline. "The Cthulhu Mythos has
always been created by 'divers hands', with lots of different writers
contributing to an ever-evolving mythology. My story drew most
directly upon the writings of Lovecraft, but there's also a little bit
of Robert Chambers in there. A few characters were drawn from the
Skotos games, while some backgrounds came from Chaosium books written
by another collection of various peoples. Our releasing this comic
under Creative Commons just makes it official: other authors can use
our Cthulhuoid contributions."

<p>Skotos' Lovecraft Country game was released this year, and is
available for play at <a target="_blank"
