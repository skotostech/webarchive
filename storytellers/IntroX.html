						</div>
						<p><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">A StoryTeller tells stories without having to build worlds. He interacts directly with StoryPlayers as a Guide or a Host or the creator of a story.<br>
						<br>
						If you enjoy gamemastering in a favorite roleplaying world or you like telling stories about a well-known historical period, then StoryTelling is for you. You won't need to create whole new worlds, but will instead be able to adapt and use ones created by Skotos employees or by your fellow Skotos community members.<br>
						<br>
						Alternatively, you may just enjoy helping people &#151; acting as Guide or a knowledgeable character in Skotos games. StoryTelling covers these activities as well.<br>
						<br>
						<a name="continued"></a>Skotos is initially planning three types of games: Stages, Grand Theatres, and Worlds. StoryTellers will have a place in each of them.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Stages<br>
						</b><br>
						Stages are small-scale locales designed specifically for StoryTellers. They're scenes that should be fun for short-term games. A medieval inn; an old, spooky castle; a doomed ocean liner; and a far future casino are all examples of Stages that could be created.<br>
						<br>
						To get used to the idea of Stages, you might want to help another StoryTeller run a Stage first. Offer to act as a Host, taking on the role of a major character.<br>
						<br>
						Afterward, you can choose a Stage and plot out a story to run. If you've ever played in a Live Action Roleplaying (LARP) game or if you've ever participated in a murder mystery night, then you should have a good idea of the type of story that you'll need to put together. You'll sketch out a number of characters &#151; perhaps as few as a dozen, perhaps as many as a hundred &#151; and assign them conflicting motives. Then you'll create some props that will be required using the StoryBuilding Toolkit. After that, it's just a question of choosing a time, assigning roles, and actually playing your game.<br>
						<br>
						Stages are the heart of the StoryTelling experience. You'll have control over an entire story: modifying the setting (Stage); creating the characters; and outlining the plot. Then you set the gears running and see what happens.<br>
						<br>
						<i>Stages for StoryTellers are expected to become availabe in January 2001.<br>
						</i><br>
						<b>Grand Theatres<br>
						</b><br>
						Grand Theatres are already contain ongoing stories. They're social venues featuring plots that could extend for years. However, StoryTellers still have a place within Grand Theatres.<br>
						<br>
						Most Grand Theatres will allow StoryTellers to apply for Host positions. You can ask to play the role of an important character within the Grand Theatre. Unlike with a Stage, you won't get to create the whole story. Rather, you'll be part of a collaborative effort. You'll be roleplaying an important character within the story and also developing plots centered around that character. You'll get to regularly chat with the other StoryTellers involved with the Grand Theatre and together plot out the story's future.<br>
						<br>
						<i>StoryTellers will be able to apply for positions in Castle Marrach, the first Grand Theatre, in late 2000.<br>
						</i><br>
						<b>Worlds<br>
						</b><br>
						Worlds are big games in which most events are already built-in and there's much less need for live StoryTelling. StoryBuilders did most of that work when they were creating the game. However, there will still be some need for StoryTellers:</font></p>
						<ul>
							<li><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">As Guides, who can help players to understand and enjoy the Worlds</font>
							<li><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">As Hosts, who may take the roles of some of the most pivotal NPCs in the world.</font>
						</ul>
						<p><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">As with Grand Theatres, applications will be taken for StoryTellers in worlds.<br>
						<i><br>
						Skotos Tech's first World, Alvatia, is expected to come online in late 2001. Applications for Guides will be taken at that time.</i></font></td>
