            <p><i><b>by Dave Rickey<br>
            2003-10-07</b></i><br><br>

<p><b>Note:</b> Much of today's column was triggered by debate on the <ahref="http://terranova.blogs.com/">Terra Nova Blog</a>, the contributors ofwhich have been involved in this issue for many years.<P><I>Commerce has set the mark of selfishness,<BR>The signet of its all-enslaving power,<BR>Upon a shining ore, and called it gold:<BR>Before whose image bow the vulgar great,<BR>The vainly rich, the miserable proud,<BR>The mob of peasants, nobles, priests, and kings,<BR>And with blind feelings reverence the power<BR>That grinds them to the dust of misery.<BR><B>--Percy Bysshe Shelley</i></b><P>Nobody is quite certain when players of online games <ahref="http://retailsupport.ea.com/corporate/pressreleases/uo_ebay.html">first started</a> exchanging <ahref="http://www.juliandibbell.com/playmoney/index.html">online gameitems</a> for <ahref="http://business.fullerton.edu/ecastronova/">real-world value</a>. Myfirst exposure to it came when I traded a co-worker for his Ultima OnlineBeta account, I offered to buy him lunch and we wound up at the OliveGarden. One "Tour of Italy" later, and I was in possession of a UO Beta CDand the associated keycode and login information (plus a handful ofcharacters and their items, which were wiped a week later). The fact thatthe terms of use and NDA for the Beta specifically prohibited such transfersnever gave either of us a moment's pause, he had control of something Iwanted, and I found an incentive that was sufficient for him to pass that tome. Since the long-term impact of that transaction was my finding a newcareer, I would say I got a pretty good deal.<P>Players were probably arranging such deals in Roy Trubshaw and RichardBartle's MUD1. Perhaps somebody at the University of Illinois in 1962,walking in to find both terminals of the original multiplayer computer gameSpacewar! occupied, traded a soda and a slice of pizza for a chance to takeover from one of the players. At any rate, the idea of placing value onaccess to virtual-world goods is far from new. But just as the internet madeit possible for a formerly low-revenue business in online game services toexplode in 1997 when UO launched and overnight doubled and redoubled thesize of the market, it also made it possible for a low-volume trade incollecting Pez dispensers to snowball into the multi-billion dollarjuggernaut that is <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>. And although itprobably shouldn't have been surprising, it took only a few weeks for thetwo to converge and UO accounts to start showing up on eBay.<P>The first reaction of the community to this showed a split between wonderand disgust. Some looked at what was happening and saw it as a betrayal ofthe shared illusion of the game world. Others saw it as a validation ofthose worlds, a sign that what happened in those worlds was as legitimate asthe events of the "real" world. And time has not changed this, there's stilla marked split in how the players think of eBay along basically the samelines, between the purists who want eBay transactions stamped out and attacha social stigma to participating in them, and those that embrace it andengage in it regularly. Some <a href="http://www.markeedragon.net/">makequite a lot</a> of money in the trade. But still, overall, the actual fiscalimpact of these transactions isn't <ahref="http://www.juliandibbell.com/playmoney/uochart_sales.jpg">thatsignificant</a>. Where the US/European MMO market is over $200,000,000 peryear of revenue (and Asia is even bigger), it's doubtful that the secondarymarket in items and characters is even as much as 10% of that. By the sametoken, only a few thousand out of over a million accounts change handsthrough eBay and similar sites.<P>So why is it a big deal if somebody sells a character or a virtual sword tosomeone else? Why has this suddenly become such a hot topic of discussion?Well, it's not really all that sudden, there's been an ongoing debate insideof the industry over it since those initial eBay UO account sales. Attachingdollar values to items and characters raises all kinds of ugly questions. Ifyour sword is worth $300 on eBay, and I as a developer decide your swordmust be deleted, I just made $300 of your net worth disappear; What's yourpotential for action, can you sue me to make me give you back your sword?What if the sword disappeared through a bug, is this negligence? What if itwas worth $300 because it was the best sword in the game, but I introduce abetter sword and the value of yours falls to $100?<p>This is <B>not</B> a setof hypothetical situations; a company named Black Snow Interactive sued myformer employer, Mythic Entertainment, essentially because Mythic blockedaccess to the "inventory" of Camelot currency that Black Snow was sellingthrough eBay and their own website.<P>What makes it worse is that your sword isn't a sword. It's a database entrythat looks like a sword inside of the game client. Flip a couple of bits,and it isn't a sword anymore, it's a bundle of flowers or a pair of gloves.The market may assign value to it, but that value didn't <i>come</i> fromanywhere. Neither did the item; I as a developer set up a system where adatabase entry named "sword" was added to the system. I could make a millionmore as easily as making just one (actually, the hard part is not making amillion by accident).<P>The part of the sword that has value is the <i>idea</i> of the sword, what youcan do with it within the context of the game, and the value you place onthat idea and those actions. So the value of the sword is indirectly derivedfrom the value you find in the game. Just as access to the UO beta was wortha lunch at Olive Garden to me, and access to EverQuest is worth $12.95 amonth to hundreds of thousands even though access just grants you theability to manipulate database entries, what you are actually purchasing isa promise from the seller to manipulate some of those database entries in away you find more favorable.<P>Now, I slipped a word into that paragraph above with some far-reachingconsequences, did you spot it? The magic word was "derived". There isactually quite a lot of law and precedent concerning how to handle thingsthat lack inherent value, but rather derive their value from theirrelationship to something else. You've probably heard of some of thesimplest forms of these: Stock Options. I've got stock options with mycurrent employer, and they're fundamentally pretty simple: my employer haspromised to sell me stock at a certain price. If the value of that stockever exceeds the cost of excercising my options, I can convert those optionsinto a windfall. There are some embellishments about how long I need to workfor the company, and what happens if I leave, but that's the core of it; thevalue of my options derives from the value they may have in the future.Other than, they're just pieces of paper. However, there are a variety ofways for me to realize hard value from this potential future value, forexample if my options were already "above water", I could pledge them assecurity against a loan that would be paid back only when and if they wereexcercised.<P>By the same token, Player A's agreement to transfer control of a databaseentry labelled "sword" to Player B is, from one point of view, a reflectionof Player B's belief that control of the "sword" will allow them to extractmore value from the game. And suddenly we've veered into very alienterritory. You see, an arbitrary database entry has legal value only in howit is arranged and indexed, and the EULA you click on very clearly transfersany value caused by your re-arrangement of the database entries to theoperator of the game (and before the BSI vs. Mythic case petered out, afederal judge found that EULA to be valid and enforceable). But financialinstruments <i>represent</i> value, and the fact that the financial intrument isa database entry doesn't change either the value or the ownership. Your bankaccount isn't a stack of bills in the vault at your local branch, it's adatabase entry in the computer system of that branch's corporate parent. Iused to work on such computer systems; my mother worked with them most ofher life. If game characters and items are ever held to be property in andof themselves, it will almost doubtlessly be as some form of similarinstrument.<P>If you think online game design is a tough job now, imagine having to havethe design approved by the SEC and/or the Federal Reserve. And if thedatabase entry marked "sword" has real value, what is your tax liability forgetting one? If you kill the dragon and then /random for who gets the sword,is that gambling (which is a whole kettle of legal fish in itself)? Beforeyou blow this off as purely hypothetical, I would point out that I wasinformed by <ahref="http://www.american-accountant.com/profile/NH/Keene/74">PeterFriedman</a>, a CPA from New Hampshire, that the IRS has already made thevalue (or lack thereof) of an EverQuest account an issue in an estate case(the IRS arguing that it had value for the purposes of estate taxes). Thisstuff isn't going to stay theoretical for long. Sooner or later tax,divorce, or inheritance law is going to make it of immediate concern.<P>Much stranger hypotheticals have turned into <i>fait accompli</i> before we evennoticed it had happened. For example when Edward Castronova, an AssociateProfessor at CSU-Fullerton, wrote in his paper on <ahref="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=294828">VirtualWorld economics</a> that the average hourly wage for an EQ player (measuredas the composite increase of account value based on the eBay market) was$3.42 cents an hour, many people commented on how this was higher than theUS minimum wage just a decade or so earlier. What we didn't notice was thatsome had already figured this out, and set up in <ahref="http://www.juliandibbell.com/texts/blacksnow.html">Mexico</a> andRussia, places with good internet connectivity and low wages, paying peopleto play the games and accumulate this virtual value for sale on the openmarket.<P>I would submit that if people are already making their living from "playing"a game, and not a subsistence income but a living wage by the standards oftheir community, and <ahref="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3138456.stm">more than half ofthe computer crimes in Korea involve online games</a>, then while we havebeen arguing over the ephemera of whether virtual communities were real andif a "rape" can involve nothing but words between avatars in a virtualenvironment, we have already crossed the invisible line on the slipperyslope to a very strange future.
