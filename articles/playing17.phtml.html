            <h2>The Peculiarities of Language </h2>

<p><i>"To hate a man because he was born in another country,because he speaks a different language, or because hetakes a different view on this subject or that, is agreat folly."<br>- John Amos Comenius</i><p>A year ago, I was reading a website that listed theEuropean languages that are in severe decline suchthat they were expected to be extinct within the nextfour to five generations. It approximated thecommunities still speaking the old dialects, and I wassurprised to find significant albeit dwindlingcommunities speaking archaic languages such asLivonian, Old Provencal and Cornish Gaelic. But theseare languages lagging in a time where the world'scultures are converging on one another. Thirty yearsago, the ATM machines in Toronto did not ask if youwanted a receipt in seven different languages.<p>Language says much about the development of a culture.Words exist in some languages that do not exist inothers, and certain languages are more descriptive ofthe lot of culture than others. As examples, I pointto the Inuktitut phenomenon of having scores of wordsdescribing different grades of snow, and the amount ofadjectives in the Yiddish language describing variousstates of misery. As any Canadian will know, butsurely this exists elsewhere, languages rally and evendefine minorities within a country. This may lead topolitical conflict. In Northern Ireland, the Catholicminority often uses Gaelic as a means ofdifferentiating themselves from their Protestantbrethren, and thus the language itself, one far moreancient than the civil strife that plagues the region,becomes a tool of politics and identity. In Turkey,the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the transitionperiod that immediately followed was symbolised byAttaturk's decision to change the Turkish language toone that used the Latin alphabet rather than theArabic one. Many authors argue that before 1848 andthe great Spring of Nations whereby minoritiesthroughout Europe rose up against their colonialmasters, there was no equivalent to the moderndefinition of "ethnicity," and different peoples weredefined in linguistic or religious terms.<p>This is a sort of conflict that is incredible toanalyse, because of the fundamental nature of whatlanguage represents: the expression of one'sperspective of the world. While I believe that oneshould take Comenius' quote above to heart, I alsobelieve that the conflict that arises with differencesin language, or at least recreating the symbolism ofdifferent languages, can be a very interesting aspectto add to a persistent game world.  Unfortunately, itis very difficult to recreate this incredible force ofhistory in the confines of a computer game, much moreso than religion, economics or any other intangiblemechanism used to fuel change in the world. Especially if you choose a more ancient setting, youcannot possibly expect to have a market that speaksancient Nubian. If your game requires the workingknowledge of two languages, your target market willshrink immensely, although since moving to Europe Ihave since learned that it would not shrink completelygiven the amount of people who speak severallanguages. Are there many ways to sidestep thisbarrier, or is this just one more unfortunatesacrifice one must make for playability? I am not sosure.<p>In Castle Marrach, the language question is approachedquite ingeniously, as it works on the limited theorythat to a person who hears a language in which theyare completely unfamiliar, that language will soundlike utter gibberish. Yes, they will be able toidentify sounds, or prominent syllables, but otherwisethe listener will not be able to understand anythingat all. In order to prevent the knowledge of languagesthrough linguistic similarity, such as a Swede'sability to "pick up" aspects of Norwegian given thesimilarities of the languages even though this Swededoes not formally speak Norwegian, the languages inquestion are seemingly unrelated to one another.Technically, any game can utilise this system,although the languages are generated by a computerusing syllables rather than grammar, and as such itdoes not recreate the "language representing culture"phenomenon I described earlier. Languages are used assymbols of class, a trade or professional membership.<p>In Glory of the Nile, there will be several languagesa character will be able to learn, such as the Nubianlanguage. A staff member went through particularstrains to research elements of those ancientlanguages and accurately recreate the syllables andsounds used in them, but of course the language asthey will exist in the game will not sound anything likeNubian as spoken. We are working on a computer game,after all, not translation software. However, sincemany ancient civilisations were small in size andpopulation, it was not uncommon for them to"specialise" in certain trades or professions in orderto ensure survival for their tribe. Minoan, therefore,will be an integral language for one wanting to becomemerchants, and Nubian for those interested in warfare.<p>One idea mentioned to me, an idea that will not beimplemented in Glory of the Nile but interesting toinclude here, is that upon character creation, onewould select their nationality/linguistic group(depending on the era) and automatically speak thatmother tongue.  While this would create separatecommunities within one gaming environment, I think itwould adequately represent the distrust that evolveswith differences. As well, this would create a thirdclass (supposing there were but two groups) of peoplewho learn the other or opposing language as apolitical commodity, with benefits and drawbacks. Ofcourse the tone of such a game would be much differentthan the tone we are crafting for Nile.<p>Languages are much more important than I originallyassessed them to be when I first started the game, andtheir effect on history is undeniable.
