						<p><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><i><b>by <a href="mailto:ShannonA@skotos.net">Shannon Appelcline</a></b></i></font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2"><b>November 22, 2000 &#150;</b> We've been verbized! It's been going on for a few weeks without me realizing, and then Monday night it hit me. <i>Verbized!</i></font>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Verbization, for those of you not in the linguistic loop, is the art of turning a noun into a verb. It happens all the time, particular in the world of business memos gone terribly wrong. Now <i>we</i> have joined those sordid ranks.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">In case I'm not being clear enough here, I'm taking about Marrach. Kimberly and I have often talked about her &quot;Marraching&quot;. I'm sure we're not the only ones.</font></p>
						<blockquote><i><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2"><b>Marrach</b> (m&acirc;r-ak) v. <b>marrached, marraching, marrachs</b> -tr. 1. To engage in a fun online roleplaying experience within Castle Marrach 2. To engage in a number of activities related to Castle Marrach, such as reading forums, exchanging email, or constructing web pages.</font></i></blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Verbization. Wow.</font></p>
						<p><b><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Turkey Time</font></b></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">It's nearly Thanksgiving as I write this, so I've decided to keep this week's column short and sweet: no long introspectives, no lengthy bug discussions. Just a few things to ponder this week, and I'm out of here.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">It being the season of giving thanks and all, I'd like to tell you all one of the things that all of us folks at Skotos are pretty thankful about right now. It's pretty simple: Castle Marrach appears to be successful.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">It was a very different world for us, three months ago, when we had a neat product that we were doggedly working on. We didn't know how it would be received. We didn't know if anyone would join the game. We didn't know if people would be more interested in actually interacting and roleplaying than seeing blood splattered across computer screens with increasing number of polygons.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">But they did come. <i>You</i> did come. As of Tuesday afternoon 1,302 of you had come. Not everyone stays, and not everyone will be interested in paying for Marrach (and the rest of our games) when January rolls around, but it sounds like a great start to me.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">So that's what we're thankful for: that Castle Marrach <i>isn't</i> a turkey.</font></p>
						<p><b><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Wishes for the Future</font></b></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">A <a href="TTnT_Oct26.html">few weeks ago</a> I outlined my Castle Marrach wish list: a set of mechanical <i>things</i> that would make the Castle more fun. We're not there yet, but as of this week, we're on our way.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">In the last couple of weeks, our programmers have been working very hard to provide our game developers with systems that will allow them to create objects that <i>do</i> things &#150; objects that can have special effects when manipulated. Musical instruments that can be played, that sort of thing, for a start.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">In December and January watch for a slowly increasing number of <i>cool</i> things in the Castle.</font></p>
						<p><b><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Thoughts for the Future</font></b></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">As I said, I wanted to keep things short this week, so this time around, I just have a pile of unanswered questions &#150; queries for both StoryTellers and StoryBuilders whose answers could lead to better games. I'm not going to try and answer them this week; they'll be topics for future columns.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Some questions for StoryTellers:</font></p>
						<ul>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How do you create an environments that's fun for both new and old players? (I cross reference Sam Witt's <a href="metastatic03.html">most recent article</a>, which provides a great example of involving newbies and veterans alike.)</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How do you segregate IC and OOC knowledge?</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How do you avoid upsetting players OOC based on IC discussions?</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How can you involve the most players in a StoryTeller plot?</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How do you get players to help lead plots?</font>
						</ul>
						<font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Some questions for StoryBuilders:</font>
						<ul>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How do you build games that stand up to constant replaying?</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How do you build games that stand up to a variety of types of gameplay?</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How can StoryBuilding in advance decrease the need for StoryTelling in the moment?</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How can you coordinate multiple StoryBuilders?</font>
							<li><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">How can you incorporate community input into your StoryBuilding, and do you want to?</font>
						</ul>
						<font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">Food for thought? Grist for future columns. Tell me what interests you!</font>
						<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,sans-serif" size="2">In the meantime, enjoy <i>your</i> turkeys this weekend.</font></p>
