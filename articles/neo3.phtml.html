<p> Certain commercial or private efforts (not unlikeSkotos) have  done their parts to leave excellent footnotes on thepages of MUD  history.  These groups and companies have, to befair, left people  with good memories of beautifully-run games.  Butthe best efforts  have been almost entirely closed-source.  In theend, they've  disappeared without a trace when they failed, orstopped advancing  when their funding dried up, or otherwise languishin obscurity.  Free MUDs, by contrast, just haven't advanced veryfast.  When  opensource is making leaps and bounds in so manyother areas, and  when source has been available for so many MUDservers for so many  years, why is free MUD development lagging?</p><h3> Internet Time </h3><p> MUDs are strange beasts.  Parser technology thatwas standard in  MUD2 and Zork still isn't common in most currentcommon codebases.  A few genuinely new MUD codebases appear on thescene, but they tend  to gain acceptance slowly, if at all.  The codebasesthat a new MUD  administrator will hear about are old, even ifthere's still some  small amount of new development.  CircleMUD, Smaug,ROM, Lima,  DiscWorld, TinyMUSH.  These are not new, and they'repretty static.  The occasional new feature wanders into some ofthem, but they don't  change a lot, and they don't improve frequently. There are very  popular codebases that have made no more than abugfix in years.  And it's <i>not</i> because they're already tooperfect to  improve. </p><p> MUDs had been on the internet for many years whenthe boom  happened.  Yet they're still not on 'internet time'the way that  successful Linux projects are.  A few, likeCircleMUD, make  reasonable use of the 'net.  But among the others,few even keep an  informative website.  None are making significantoverhauls of their  codebases.  None of the old standby codebases areadding large new  features, not even to match each other. </p><p> In the LPMUD world, almost all the currentfeatures were available  in TMI-2 in 1994.  The design wasn't pretty, but ithad features  like good parsing and support for FTP, finger andHTTP.  The LPMUD  state of the art has barely advanced since then. That's ten years,  well before the internet boom and the massive influxof new players  and new programmers.  That's a long time.  CircleMUDhas been slowly  advancing in the same time, but overall it's inchingforward, not  growing by leaps and bounds.  Smaug, ROM, thevarious MUSH and MOO  codebases all have similar stories. </p><h3> Lost in the Noise </h3><p> One reason is that existing information is hard tofind.  I worked  on a custom C/Perl server architecture for over ayear before I  found a codebase that already did what I wanted.  Iwound up  throwing away a year of work when I switched to thenew server.  That's demoralizing, to say the least.  MUDinformation is indexed  poorly, and many projects don't maintain a web sitewith even a  basic description of what they're doing.  Findinginformation about  MudOS on the MudOS site, or the PernMUSH code on anyof the various  PernMUSH sites, is surprisingly difficult.</p><h3> Hey!  You Can't Touch That! </h3><p> Another reason is licensing.  The Diku license ispoorly  understood and shoddily enforced.  It has hadseveral ugly scandals,  most prominently the mess with Medivia's flagrantlicense  violations.  All the major Diku-derived codebases(Smaug, ROM, Merc,  Circle) labor under the same conditions, with thesame problems.  The few opensource Diku-style MUDs, like ScryMUD,tend to be poorly  documented with fewer features, and aren't advancingquickly.  They're also not as popular as the codebases bearingthe old Diku  license, even among people starting new MUDs. </p><p> LPMUDs aren't much better.  The original LPMUDlicense absolutely  prevents making money off any MUD derived from thesame codebase.  It's not entirely clear what that disallows, andproblems similar to  Diku have arisen among LPMUDs as well.  All themajor LPMUDs labor  under that license, or some variation on it -- Lima,CDLib, Amylaar,  DiscWorld.  DGD is slightly better, but a commerciallicense is  prohibitively expensive for hobbyist MUDs, exceptpotentially  through Skotos.  Shattered World, which is GPL'd, isthe only  exception I'm aware of among LP-style MUDs. Shattered might help  things eventually, but currently it labors inobscurity.</p><p>  MUD Licensing has had several ugly chapters, such asthe vast number  of MUDs breaking Diku license by not acknowledgingthe authors, and  the smaller number selling in-game items orsoliciting donations in  flagrant violation of the Diku license.  There isvery little  respect to be found for the work of codebase authorsin the forums  and mailing lists of MUD development web sites. There are only a  scant handful of good MUD codebases under anOSI-approved opensource  license.  It's no wonder that codebases advance soslowly, or that  principled and fiery young authors will usuallystart from nothing,  hoping to build a better codebase.</p><p>  Unfortunately, duplicating the functionality of anexisting codebase  is a huge task.  Such authors usually fail.  Sincethey never  release their efforts, they leave the world noricher for their  attempt.  While most plan to release source 'whenit's done', it  never gets done and so they never release anythingat all.</p><h3> Why Not GNU to the Rescue? </h3><p>  Opensource MUDs don't accumulate features the waythat other  opensource projects tend to.  The GNU General PublicLicense (GPL)  is hated by many because if you make a modifiedversion of a GPL  application, you have to give away the source.  Ifyou add a cool  new feature, you have to let other people have thesource to that  feature, and you have to let them use it.  That'salso the GPL's  strongest feature since it makes many people grittheir teeth and  give away the source.  The features they just addedare often pretty  nice...  And that makes using and modifying theapplication even  more attractive.  As a result, the body ofGPL-licensed code gets  constantly stronger as new people makecontributions.  That's the  'viral' feature of the GPL that Microsoft hates somuch, and that  Richard Stallman touts so highly.  Well, it doesn'ttouch MUD  servers -- and we can all watch the consequences ofthat.  Even a  GPL'd MUD server simply doesn't work that way.  Butwhy?</p><p>  MUD servers, unfortunately, break the usefulness ofthe GPL on a  technicality.  You can simply run a MUD server athome and let other  people connect to it.  That means you're not givingaway a binary of  your MUD server.  The GPL only requires you to givesource to the  same people you give a binary to.  You never have togive away a  binary, so you never give away source.  The GPL'sintended purpose  is foiled.  There is <i>no</i> existing license thatdoes for MUD  servers what the GPL does for applications.  Thatgrudging spread of  features has never happened for MUD servers the wayit has for  GPL-licensed applications and libraries.  And soGPL-licensed MUD  servers like Shattered World and ScryMUD havelanguished.</p><h3> Keep Your Chin Up </h3><p>  I could go on about what holds back free MUDdevelopment for another  column, or another three.  I could talk about theschisms between  Diku and LPMUD developers, MUD or MUSH, simulationor gameplay.  I  could talk about the Balkanization of MUDdevelopment efforts, the  lack of compatibility and the various otherobstacles holding it  back.  I could probably talk for a full articleabout how much  current MUD development is like old Unixdevelopment, the wildly  unsuccessful kind that happened before Linux.</p><p>  It can wait.  You've probably heard enough about theobstacles for  now.  Let's talk about what you <i>should</i> do,what existing  codebases are doing right, and what you shouldconsider imitating.  Let's talk about the obstacles that you <i>can</i>fix easily.  Let's talk about the ones that <i>don't</i> requireyou to worry  about developer holy wars, or whose codebase isbetter.</p><p>  Those issues are out there.  There's a lot that youcan do to keep  your own code good, and to reverse the bad trendsjust by ignoring  them.  But those are topics for another column.  Seeyou in two  weeks, when I'll talk about labor-saving code, andwhy you might not  need to write a novel's worth of text for your MUD!</p>
