            <h2>The Great Figures of Historical Gaming </h2>
            <p><i><b>by Michael Karlin<br>

<p><i>"While the sea of history remains calm theruler-administrator in his frail bark, holding on witha boat hook to the ship of the people and himselfmoving, naturally imagines that his efforts move theship he is holding on to. But as soon as a stormarises and the sea begins to heave and the ship tomove, such a delusion is no longer possible."</i><br>-Lev Tolstoy, Author<p>I wrote an essay in the first year of my undergraduatedegree, an essay where I first encountered theso-called Great Leader of History problem. It seemsthat many historians, especially political historians,liked to believe that extraordinary events in historywere the product solely of one or two great leaders,and everyone else played a meagre, supporting role. Myprofessor explained to me that this is rarely true,and that to paint over overwhelmingly complex social,spiritual and economic forces that drive and motivategreat strides forward or backward in humancivilisation is mocking history.<p>But you’re here to have fun, and not write essays. I'mhere to entertain you, and to not mark you.<p>When creating a historical fiction game, especially aroleplaying game wherein social interaction isimportant, you may decide to include a great figure ofhistory, someone people outside your niche interestrecognise and can reasonably measure their importanceto the time. There is a slight difficulty that arises here. Firstly, there is a tremendous amount ofinformation on many great leaders, much of whichconflicts when describing their personality. Sometexts will say this general was gruff, whilst anothersuggests that he may have been aloof.  Legend saysCleopatra was beautiful, yet CAT scans of hersarcophagus suggest otherwise. Was Communist leader ofYugoslavia Josip Tito a brutal oppressor or benevolentdictator? When faced with this problem, it will beyour task to sort through the nonsense, pick out thetreasured works on the leader, and figure out whichparadigm you are going to choose. Then you don'tsimply tell the players how your game will interprettheir behaviour, you show them through roleplaying thecharacter.<p>The second issue, reverse of the first, is thedifficult task of forging a character using too littleinformation. How much is really known about Attila theHun or Cyrus the Great? We know of their deeds, but toroleplay a character properly, you need information ontheir personalities as well. There are a few solutionsto this problem. <p>Lastly, if you use a great historicalfigure in your game, you will be obliged to replicatetheir deeds in some way, and players will most likelywant to take part in that. The players are playing thegame because they  like that particular era inhistory, and so there exists a certain obligation tomake the events that make this era special come true.<p><b>1) A Moderate Figure Solution to a Great FigureProblem</b><p>You can avoid the use of a great figure in history byusing a moderate figure solution, or using a leader(if you have one) who was not as well known as thegreat figure. <i>Glory of the Nile</i> takes place at thebeginning of the rule of Pharaoh Amenhotep I, anintriguing figure of whom little is known. We knowsimply that the beginning of his 25-year rule wasmarked with small border skirmishes and modestterritorial gains, and the rest of his rule was markedby building, consolidation of the religion, and socialpolicy. Because there is little known about hispersonality, I can fabricate the character I want towrite.<p>Don't think that moderately-important leaders are notintegral to history; it was the people who built onformer accomplishments, consolidated rather thanexpanded empires, elaborated rather thanrevolutionised religions, that allowed some of thegreat civilisations to flourish. If you only had greatand poor leaders, kingdoms would have risen and fallenevery twenty years and societies would not have grownto the extent that they did. Amenhotep I did not expelforeign invaders like his father Ahmose, nor did hedouble the size of the empire like Thutmose III, orerect the largest construction project in humanhistory like Khufu. He simply built, exploited naturalresources, opened trade routes, protected the landsfrom invading tribes, and beautified the cities. Hewas one of the few Pharaohs to be worshipped as a godon Earth after his death,  not just a demigod as mostPharaohs, and simply for the fact that he made lifeliveable.<p><b>2) Delegate Responsibility</b><p>Another facet to the moderate figure solution is tocentre leadership on a powerful official lower thanthe leader of the area. This could be the benevolentlord of a village, the stern Praetor of the province,the brusque colonel of the wilderness fort, etc. Thischaracter can be completely fictional, and thus atyour creative mercy without sacrificing credibility.You could even have cameos of the great leader to "historically orient" your player base, perhapsallowing a change of leadership. This is a verypractical solution, as you do not have the awkwardchange of personality when another player takes thereigns of the leader. <p><b>3) Lie</b><p>Perhaps that is stated a bit crudely. By "lie," I meanthat you can appeal to the fictional aspect ofhistorical fiction and use the popularly-consideredcaricature of the leader rather than trying to naildown exactly what the leader was like. Instead ofdoubting themselves or relying on officials forinformation, make them bold and fearless, a grandforce of personality. Play a myth, rather than a manor woman. While this strategy probably will not leadto a very realistic interpretation of history, itprobably will result in an entertaining one.<p><b>4) The Foot of God Solution</b><p>You know that great moment in history remembered forthe rest of the ages? It never happened. The "Foot ofGod" solution to the problem is simply to redraftevents in history by asking a lot of hypotheticalquestions. What if Alexander I made Russia moredemocratic like he promised? What if Caesar didn’tdie? What if the Axis won the First World War? Ibelieve that the occurrence and outcome of greatevents change the people as much as the people changethe events, so your great leaders of history will lookcompletely different if you simply smash history andrebuild it to your liking within reasonableparameters.  I’ll discuss this issue again next month.<p>In conclusion, think about whether or not you want toinclude a great figure of history, about whichaccomplishments you want to revisit and which you wantto avoid, and about how you want to portray them.People look to the familiar faces to guide theirroleplay, to introduce them to your era, so yourchoices will be important.<p>Next month: <b>HISTORY SMASH!</b>
