<I>If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.<BR><B>Milton Berle</I></B><P>Watching new games come out, and new intiatives in old games, can be abittersweet process for me. Especially, seeing the extension of the craft ofonline game design unfold the way I expected is simultaneously a source offrustration and validation. Frustration because I can't help thinking "Iwanted to do that 3 years ago," validation because, after all, it *worked*.I wasn't crazy, I wasn't drawing impossible plans for castles in the air,but in fact had an idea that was practical, useful, and within reach, butjust a little too hip for the room.<P>I'm not going to say *what* series of feature announcements for which gamestriggered this; the people who actually made them happen first deserveunfiltered credit for their achievements. Rather, I'm going to go on recordwith a list of future advances I expect to see become standard over the nextthree to five years. Some of this may be obvious, some of it may not beobvious for a while, some may turn out to be flat wrong.<P><B>1) Distributed computing based on blade-architecture systems using OSScomponents (OS, DBMS, and others) will become the standard serverenvironment.</B><BR>Right now there is no "standard environment"; every server-side architecturehas been built from scratch to service a particular game. However, there aresome obvious common requirements between games, and as companies thatalready have operating games get the opportunity to build from scratch theywill be looking to leverage R&D across multiple projects. This willcross-fertilize between companies through both public and private channels,and eventually a fairly standard architecture will emerge.<P>This architecture will center on blade computers because the economics ofthe blade design are obvious. It's standardized equipment, using PCcomponents with all the economies of scale that implies, and with all of theuser-friendly bells and whistles of a PC stripped out to lower the price.Cycle for cycle, you get two to five times as much processing bang for yourbuck, without getting locked into a particular vendor or having to teachyour programmers a totally foreign environment.<P>The basic plumbing will be Open Source Software for similar reasons. Nobodyseriously considers writing a custom Operating System anymore, and few wouldreally want to use a home-brewed database. And where using standardcommercial software will add to your overhead and lock you into licenseterms that may restrict your game design later, OSS is free as in beer andfree as in speech--you can do anything you want to with it on the serverside without ever having to let anyone not working for you see your sourcecode. This will be a win-win for both the game developers and the OSSsystems they adopt.<P>This standard architecture will be centered on "entities" or someequivalent, small processes representing mobs, players, spawn zones, andother specialized logic that run on blades and communicate with the rest ofthe server in standardized ways, handling things that apply to a very narrowfocus and relying on messaging protocols to receive inputs and dispatchoutputs. These message protocols will do the heavy lifting on keeping trackof what is happening where, but will contain no logic on what to *do* aboutany of it, the logic of the entities will all be at the edges, decentralizedas much as feasible (truly emergent systems will be a lot longer in coming,if ever, but we'll start faking it better).<P>I'll go into more detail about how this will work in some future column, fornow we'll leave it a black box.<P><B>2) AI will become increasingly important, and increasinglysubtle.</B><BR>Right now our AI is brain-dead stupid. It's barely able to function at themost minimal of levels (wait until you notice a player, run towards playeruntil within range, attack until dead), and sometimes not all that effectiveat that. This is partly from necessity, partly from laziness, and partlyfrom fear. The necessity stems from a few years back, when runningthousands of AI agents on affordable hardware meant they had to be strippeddown to the absolute minimum. The laziness is because having found it waspossible to keep players as subscribers with such incredibly stupid AI,there seemed little incentive to improve it. And the fear is because everytime the AI attributes of the player's familiar surroundings changes in anyway, the players howl in pain. City of Heroes currently has the mostsophisticated AI of any MMO, with NPC healers smart enough to teleport awaywhen under attack and teleport back to heal their comrades.<P>However, while we've been creating armies of thousands of marching morons,academics and defense-industry programmers have been working on relatedproblems with different incentives. In the academic world, Artificial Lifeis nearly a solved problem, with many different proven methodologies forreproducing lifelike behaviour <i>in silico</i>. And Defense Departmentcombat simulators have come a long way since the days when packs ofkangaroos busted out SAM's and started shooting down simulated helicoptergunships.<P>Seven years ago, Ultima Online's attempt to create an artificial ecologyfailed. Although there were some fundamental flaws in their model (forexample, the lack of aging or natural death combined with unlimitedindividual creature potential leading to super-trained unkillablepredators), in fact the real problem was that the number of top predators(player characters) the system was designed for was exceeded by a factor often in the actual live game, who then went out and killed everything insight, reducing the world to a wasteland. But the failure was so spectacularthat it has been nearly impossible to even bring the idea up in a designmeeting without it (and often the presenter) being laughed out of theroom.<P>Instead, squads of world builders have populated worlds one database entryat a time, and hand-tuned the parameters of very simple Finite State MachineAI that was otherwise standard to all creatures in the world. However, thesize of world that is expected by the players, and the level of detaildemanded by the players, is quickly creating a situation where creatingthose worlds by hand will be prohibitively expensive. The generation ofgames now on the verge of launch will probably be the last to have worldsbuilt by painstaking hand craftsmanship. Future efforts are going to have toturn to AI and A-Life based approaches. There's actually a large amount ofprior art just in single-player games for this: Will Wright and PeterMolyneux have been building AI based software toys for years, and I'vementioned in a <ahref="engines07.shtml.html">previous column</a>that we could take a lot from strategy games to improve ours. Again, I'llhave to wait for a future column to explain the nuts and bolts of this.<P><B>3) Character art detail will plateau, soon.</B><BR>This will be a kind of preview of what will happen later with photo-realismin world graphics, but it will happen sooner. For a variety of reasonshaving to do with how the human mind processes visual input, more realisticcharacter art is starting to look <B>worse</B>, rather than better, to theplayers. Humans expect a lifelike human face to show all the subtleties offacial express and body language of living person, and when it doesn't, theresults aren't immersive, they're just creepy. This is why the Final Fantasymovie bombed, why The Polar Express movie will bomb, and why people don'tlike to look at the virtual <ahref="http://slate.msn.com/id/2102086">Jennifer Garner or Vin Diesel'sfaces</a> in the Alias and Chronicles of Riddick games that were recentlyreleased: The artificiality of their limited facial expressions just looks<b>wrong</b>.<P>So we're going to see a sudden halt in the increasing realism of charactergraphics, with a standard emerging somewhere close to that of CoH or SWG,and the emphasis shifting towards greater customization and personalizationof almost cartoonish characters in increasingly realistic worlds.<P><B>4) Someone is going to pre-empt eBay.</B><BR>Ever since the first UO character was sold, the (usually) unspoken punchlinewhenever the "eBay Problem" was discussed was that the <b>real</B> problemwith eBay is that we (the game operators) aren't getting a cut. Except for afew "games" (I use the quotes deliberately) that were predicated on thebusiness model of selling virtual nothings to the players, no-one has beenquite ready to take the obvious next step: Replace eBay. The current graymarket has grown up in spite of huge fraud potential stemming from the factthat there was no way to tie together the two ends of the transaction. Inthe real world, real money traded hands, in the virtual world virtual goodschanged control, but the two exchanges were not linked and frequently oneside or another works out a way to keep both.<P>It doesn't have to be that way. The game operators already have the player'scredit card numbers, and can secure the transaction just like any othertrade (taking a cut, of course). Nobody is certain exactly how much realmoney is trading hands over virtual items, but it is pretty certain that ifthe more obviously trustworthy game operator was acting as guarantor of thetransaction, that number would skyrocket.<P>For a long time the game operators have been edging up to the line,wondering how close they can get without triggering outrage in the generalplayerbase. Linden Labs (Second Life) is out in front on this, having workedout an official arrangement with the "Gaming Open Market". Sooner or later,someone is going to grab this danger/opportunity with both hands, and ifthey get away with it, the others won't be long in following.<P><B>5) Cable/DSL Providers will get more involved in online games.</B><BR>Broadband providers are getting very competitive (but in a very selectiveway, a given area generally has only two real broadband competitors: CableModem monopoly, and Regional Bell DSL monopoly), and in many of the largestmarkets they've already gone as far as they can in competing on price. Nowthey've started looking for content to lock up in exclusive arrangements.They're spending millions to get rights for music videos, movie trailers,and other high-bandwidth internet content, and they're used to thinking intimescales of years. Sometime in the next decade, they're going to realizethat a *large* chunk of their broadband users are wanting the connection inorder to play games, and they're going to start investing. The first stagesof this may come soon, custom expansions for popular small-scale multiplayergames available only to customers of a particular provider (for example, thespecial Comcast/SBC/AT&T mission pack for Doom III or The Sims).On the scales of broadband providers, online game development costs arechicken feed. And with 85% of MMO players on broadband, and their broadbandprovider making more money from them than the MMO operator, this merging ofbusiness models should be only a matter of time.  <ahref="http://info.supereva.it/the4thcoming/index.html?p">The FourthComing</a> may simply have been premature.<P>Going out on a limb and making firm predictions like this is risky, butexcept for #5 (which depends on an industry I have little exposure to andtherefore don't understand the politics of), all of these seem as inevitablecourses for the industry to take over the next few years. Check back with mein 2009.<P>
