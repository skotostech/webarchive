<p>So there I was, at a gaming convention, about to play a LARPI was looking forward to set in the Firefly universe; which I love; and hostedby a good friend of mine. </p><p>Unfortunately, I had screwed up and come right before theLARP without signing up ahead of time. In the "Ol' Days" this was perfectly acceptable.  Now, to my joy but at the time chagrin, thereis so much interest in LARPing that games fill up and you may be in trouble ifyou haven't gone through official channels to secure a spot.  As a result I put my name and that of myhusband's on the spillover list and hoped for the best.  While waiting to see if we had gotten in, Istruck up a conversation with a woman about my age whose boyfriend was offplaying some tabletop D&amp;D.  She hadnever played in a LARP before, but a mutual friend of ours had directed her tothis game thinking she'd enjoy it.  Shewas a mild-mannered school teacher who in fact had been dragged to thisconvention by said boyfriend and wasn't much of a gamer at all.  She had never watched an episode of Fireflyeither.  I got busy filling her in thebest I could.  </p><p>The moment had now come and those of us who were latecomerswere given the last character picks. In case you aren't familiar with Fireflyit is basically a western set in space, with colonized planets standing in asfrontier towns.  This particular gametook place on a mining colony/town; a rough place.  The female character choices remaining to me(and mind all the male ones were already taken) were basically Madam of thebrothel or non-prostitute.  I pickedthe latter.  This stuck our schoolteacher friend with the Madam character. Oops.  She was reallyuncomfortable with this choice of characters and I really didn't want it eitherso through some convoluted trading operation which I still can't quiteunderstand, the school teacher gave the Madam to my other friend, I gave mycharacter to the teacher and my friend passed on to me...</p><p>...Down on her luck prostitute (it <b>was</b> a mining town after all). I read the character over and over, looking for something to latchonto.  It was an interesting character,in a way.  Some poor gal who was stuck inthe brothel but was looking for a way out. She had some information and items that she might have been able to useto her advantage to leave her dismal situation. But you just couldn't get around the fact that she was beholden to hermadam and at the beck and call of all the filthy miners.  She was still a space whore. </p><p>So there I was, at a gaming convention, about to play a LARPI was looking forward to set in the Firefly universe; which I love; and hostedby a good friend of mine – and I walked away. I had <i>never</i> done that before, and the fact it was a friend's LARP madeit all the harder.  I felt guilty forabandoning him and I couldn't help but feel my hardcore gamer pride shrivel abit at having turned down a "challenging" role. There are some places, however, where even us hardcore gamers don't wantto take our role-playing.  Even though Ifelt bad, I felt it likely that I had just escaped from a many hour sessionwhere I would have spent the entire time feeling uncomfortable and on edge.</p><p>There is, of course, a moral to this story.  Nobody wants to be a space whore.  The choice to populate the mining colony withprostitutes made perfect sense from a narrative stand-point.  The character I was to play would have beenan interesting one in a play or trite romance novel.  But it didn't work as a LARP character,because very few female gamers would have felt comfortable playing it.  The space whore moral can be distilled tothis: make characters with your players in mind.  </p><p>When designing characters for a LARP or online RPG, considerthe players and not just the story.  Itis tempting to consider your game in broad dramatic narrative strokes, butalways remember that this as a game and not just a story.  Characters that are downtrodden and oppressedmay make fodder for an interesting story because of the tragedy surroundingthem but that doesn't make them fun to play. Sexuality is a touchy subject for a lot of people, so its important thatthere are alternative choices for people who do not want to play that sort ofcharacter.  If you are setting up a game,especially at a convention or online  whereyour players will be people you may not necessarily know you will want to avoidforcing people into extreme backgrounds even if it "fits the story" or wouldbring a good "point of conflict."  Byextreme backgrounds, we mean anything that may cause uncomfortable gutreactions in a fair majority of random players that lead them to not want toplay your game.  Downtrodden space whoresfall into this category but so do characters who represent certain ills of oursociety, such as racist characters or brutal mass murderers.  In a different type of game players may createtheir own characters with an extreme background that interests them, but thatwould be by their own choice and they wouldn't be forced into something thatoffends them or makes them unhappy.</p><p>In this particular game, it wouldn't have been so bad ifthere were only one or two space whore characters (occasionally there <b>is</b> somebody who wants to be a spacewhore), but there seemed to be a gaggle of them.  The game would have been much better servedwith a smaller selection of extreme character backgrounds and a larger varietyof milder character backgrounds that a new player like the mild-mannered schoolteacher could be interested in.  Sometimesthere will be border line cases where you aren't completely sure if thecharacter you are designing could be considered "extreme".  If you are unsure if a character type you'reconsidering for a game might be offensive or bothersome, a simple solution isto ask someone their opinion.  Preferablysomeone not in your regular gaming group who might hold the same biases as you.</p><p>So there I was, at a party a couple weeks ago where I met upwith the friend who had run the above referenced Firefly game.  I still felt guilty for walking out of hisgame but we were choosing not to talk about it and instead were talking aboutnew LARP ideas.  I was telling him aboutthis great new concept I had.  "Soeveryone's a pirate see, and once a year all the pirates come to this island tohave a <i>really</i> big party, kind of like a pirate prom, and they get all crazyand...." He cut me off with a very serious look on his face "Look, take my adviceon one thing," he said grimly "when making characters, do NOT, under anycircumstances, make a bunch of whores."</p>
