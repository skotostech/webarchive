<u>FADE IN:</u>

<u>EXT. CASTLE MARRACH - DAY</u>

A cold, wintry mountaintop, upon which rises the ancient Castle
Marrach. Turrets rise up to the sky obscuring the clouds. Smoke
belches forth from the chimneys, but other than that the Castle seems
oddly empty. SUPERIMPOSE: <u>APRIL 26, 2001</u>.

A drawbridge marks the entrance to the Castle, but the drawbridge is
currently up, its solid wooden planks blocking the Castle's gate.

In front of the Castle's gate, stand a MOTLEY CROWD OF CASTLE
DWELLERS. There are dozens of them representing the entire hierarchy
of the Castle, from the rank-and-file servants wearing plain homespun
tunics and pants to the royalty who are attired in the finest damask,
satin, and silk.

Standing a number of yards in front of the Castle Dwellers is SHANNON,
a man in his late 20s, casually, perhaps sloppily, dressed. He looks a
bit nervous.  A LOUD RUMBLE comes from the Castle dwellers, as they
gossip, argue, threaten, and politick.

                         SHANNON
                 (shouting at the crowd)
           Excuse me! Excuse me! We're trying to
           film a column here!

Shannon clears his throat a few more times and the loud rumble slowly
quiets. It's more of a DULL RUMBLE now.

                         SHANNON
                 (turning forward and 
                 shaking his head)
           Sorry about that folks. I've got my
           friends all gathered here to help
           make a point toward the end of the
           column, but they're a little
           impatient about the wait--

A PIMPLY LAD in the crowd becomes agitated and begins shouting.

                         PIMPLY LAD
           A sword! I want a sword! Where can I
           get a sword?

                         SHANNON
           And as it turns out I probably
           shouldn't have invited ...
           everyone ... 

Shannon glances back at the crowd and nods in approval as a crack
squad of WINTER WATCHMEN leap upon the Pimply Lad, knocking him to the
ground. In seconds they're all lost amidst the crowd.

The DULL RUMBLING increases in volume.

                         SHANNON
                 (speaking louder)
           Anyway, I talked about movie plots a
           couple of months ago and I plan to
           talk about movie characters at some
           point in the future, but in between I
           thought it might be nice to take a
           break ...
                 (shouting now)
           ... and talk about how movies <u>aren't</u>
           like Castle Marrach at all.

The Watchmen reappear at the edge of the crowd, dragging Pimply Lad
behind them. They march to the edge of one of the tall cliffs that
surround Castle Marrach, heft him up, then toss him into the ravine.

Pimply Lad bounces a few times before he's lost in the mists that
surround the slopes of Mount Arden.

SILENCE descends upon the crowd. A few of the Castle Dwellers glance
nervously at the Watchmen or at the cliff.

                         SHANNON
                 (smiling broadly)
           Much better. Now, as I was saying, I
           want to talk about how Marrach isn't
           the movies ... about the differences
           between the two mediums ... because I
           think those differences offer some
           ways to improve prose games.

The Watchmen have returned to the crowd now, where they're carefully
listening for more requests for weapons.

                         SHANNON
           There's three broad topics that I
           want to cover, and given my normal
           penchant getting to all of these will
           probably take two weeks. But, they
           are ...
                 (listing the first off
                 on the pointer finger
                 of his right hand)
           how movies are a visual medium ...
                 (then the second on his
                 middle finger)
           how movies are a discontinuous
           medium ...
                 (then the third on his
                 ring finger)
           and how movies are a contained
           medium.

Shannon stares at his fingers for a moment, confused, then closes his
hand.

                         SHANNON
           Right, and how Castle Marrach isn't.

A SOFT MURMUR has slowly begun to build around the crowd again, but
nothing like the louder ruckuses in the past.

                         SHANNON
                 (turning to address the
                 crowd)
           You guys hang around for a bit and
           I'll be back! 
                 (pauses)
           You might want to practice while I'm
           gone because we're only doing one
           take.

Numerous members of the crowd nod and the entire crowd begins to sit
down on the snow, ice, and rocks fronting Castle Marrach.

<u>INT. DINING HALL EAST - DAY</u>

The eastern dining hall is a warm and cosy room. Benches sit by a pair
of tables. A fireplace, complete with roaring fire, takes up the
eastern half of the room.

Shannon slowly fades into the room. SUPERIMPOSE: <u>PART I: MOVIES ARE A
VISUAL MEDIUM.</u>

                         SHANNON
                 (surveying the room and
                 looking perturbed)
           My whole goal here was to have folks
           in the Castle help me demonstrate
           stuff this week, but--
                 (pauses)
           They're all outside practicing the--
                 (pauses again)
           Well, I won't spoil it, but they <u>are</u>
           practicing.

Shannon paces back and forth for a moment, then SNAPS his fingers.

                         SHANNON
           Got it! We'll just jump back in time
           a few months and then I'll have
           plenty of folks to help my
           demonstration.
                 (pauses)
           But I should probably explain what
           I'm talking about first. People tell
           me that's usually a good idea ...
           often after I've failed to do exactly
           that thing.

Shannon reaches up into the air and plucks forth a slightly battered
red notebook with a number of arcane squiggles on the cover.

Looking about, he spots one of the Dining Halls' benches, and sits
down on it before he begins leafing through the book.

                         SHANNON
                 (looking up from his
                 notebook)
           I've got written here, in my
           screenwriting class notes, that
           movies are primarily a visual medium.
           My teacher stated that you're need to
           tell a story in pictures, that you're
           doing more than just presenting
           dialogue.
                 (pauses)
           And, if you think about your favorite
           movies, you'll realize that the
           visuals were very powerful devices.

Shannon looks thoughtful for a second, offering viewers the clich&eacute;d
clue that they're about to be bombarded with visuals from his mind's
eye.

<u>EXT. SPACE - LONG, LONG AGO</u>

A space station the size of a small moon sits amidst blackness.

A single tiny fighter breaks free of the station just as explosions
begin to wash across the station's face. In seconds it blossoms into a
huge fireball.

<u>EXT. A PLAYGROUND - THE NEAR FUTURE</u>

A muscular woman stares through a chain link fence at children in a
playground. They're enjoying themselves, totally oblivious of what's
about to come. The woman clutches the fence with her hands as a
mushroom cloud blooms in the distance.

Fire begins to wash over everything. The woman's hair streams behind
her for a moment, then the flesh begins to strip from her face.

<u>INT. SCHOOL STAIRWELL - LAST YEAR</u>

A young boy looks up a stairwell and sees three pilgrims hanging from
nooses. They are grotesquely dead.

<u>INT. DINING HALL EAST - DAY</u>

Shannon's eyes are slowly focusing, offering a clich&eacute;d signal that we
just exited his memories.

                         SHANNON
           I'm not sure exactly how those scenes
           are written, but that's how they've
           stuck in my mind.
                 (pauses)
           The point is that movies are a very
           visual medium while a prose game like
           Marrach isn't. And as we're going to
           see in a moment that offers room for
           improvement in prose games.

Shannon hops off the bench. When he turns around his red notebook
is gone.

                         SHANNON
                 (cracking his knuckles)
           So we're going to jog back a few
           months and see how non-visual a prose
           game can be.
                 (pauses)
           Go ahead and start without me! I'm
           going to pop by the Castle gate for a
           second.

Everything begins to go fuzzy.

<u>INT. DINING HALL EAST - A FEW MONTHS AGO</u>

The dining hall east appears much as it did before, except there are
now a HANDFUL OF PEOPLE here. Among them are AVERON, a slightly unruly
looking man wearing a pin depicting the masks of tragedy and comedy
and OMMALE, a distinguished elderly man wearing a rosette.

                         AVERON
           The Poet's Brotherhood sucks.

                         OMMALE
           I once saw a rose that made me think,
           would such beauty exist if there was
           no one to see it?

                         AVERON
           You spit upon poets of quality and
           admit mutes into your society.

                         OMMALE
           To see or not to see, that is the
           only question.

                         AVERON
           And even though I offer poems in the
           classic styles, you look down upon
           them. Perhaps they make too much
           sense, old man?

                         OMMALE
           Once, when I sat upon the Castle's
           highest turret, I thought, what if
           the sun did not rise but for my being
           there to greet it?

Shannon slowly fades into the Dining Hall. Averon and Ommale's
argument continues at a low MURMUR.

                         SHANNON
                 (nodding at the two)
           In the movie biz, that's what they
           call &quot;talking heads&quot;. It's a
           conversation between two people
           without action. In plays you see it a
           lot, but in movies it's a real no-no.
                 (pauses)
           And it can happen really easily in a
           prose game like Castle Marrach too.
           Fortunately Marrach has a system of
           social verbs which can help combat
           this type of thing.

Shannon sits down at a bench. Meanwhile, Averon and Ommale's argument
has grown a bit more interesting.

                         AVERON
                 (fiercely smacking the
                 fireplace)
           How can you stand in this place of
           honor and call that mute's tripe
           poetry?

                         OMMALE
                 (thoughtfully gazing at
                 the ceiling)
           When clouds cross the sky, do they
           walk or run?

                         AVERON
                 (angrily pointing at
                 Ommale)
           How can you call your own tripe
           poetry?

                         OMMALE
                 (glancing at Averon's
                 finger)
           Does guilt adhere to he who blames or
           he who is blamed?

Averon silently SCREAMS and runs out of the Dining Hall East.

                         SHANNON

           I'm sure I'm not selling you much new
           here. The social verbs and adverbs in
           Marrach are well-known and well-used.

                 (pauses)
           Whether you be StoryBuilder or
           StoryTeller, however, you should try
           and think, when might gestures
           totally replace words? It's more than
           just using the most appropriate
           evocation. You can make your
           interactions more visual and thus
           more interesting by not trying to do
           everything with words.

Shannon stands up from his bench and stretches.

A low MURMUR indicates that Ommale is now carrying on a monologue,
largely unchanged from his previous dialogue with Averon.

                         SHANNON
           But, that's only the first step. As a
           StoryBuilder you need to think about
           how to take the next step, to create
           big visualizations that will be
           memorable.
                 (pauses)
           Sherman, set the wayback machine for
           April 26, 2001.

Everything begins to go fuzzy again. This time we see some cool
swirling colors before everything fades to black.

<u>FADE TO:</u>

<u>EXT. SPACE - LONG, LONG AGO</u>

A space station blossoms into a fireball.

<u>EXT. A PLAYGROUND - THE NEAR FUTURE</u>

A mushroom cloud blooms in the distance.

<u>INT. SCHOOL STAIRWELL - LAST YEAR</u>

Three pilgrims hang from nooses.

<u>FADE TO:</u>

<u>EXT. CASTLE MARRACH - DAY</u>

The crowd of Castle Dwellers is still here, all seated on the frozen
landscape.

Shannon stands in front of them, patiently waiting.

                         SHANNON
           Now, the real cool thing about a
           prose game is that if you do start
           taking advantage of visualizations
           ... your special effects budget is
           unlimited. You can do the most
           amazing things!
                 (turning to crowd)
           Hit it guys!

The Castle Dwellers to the left stand up, waving their hands above
their heads; as they begin to sit back down, the people just to
their right stand up. This pattern continues across the entire
crowd. It's The Wave!

                         SHANNON
                 (snorting and holding
                 his mouth)
           OK, OK, that probably wasn't worth
           the buildup. Sorry. Sorry.
                 (gasping for air)
           The point is you can do anything.
                 (pauses)
           To hold off the inevitable lynch
           mobs, I arranged for the following
           encore.

Shannon points to the air above Castle Marrach. Abruptly, the sun
sets, plunging the area into darkness.

<u>EXT. CASTLE MARRACH - NIGHT</u>

A fearful MURMUR arises from the crowd.

Bursts of cerulean light begin to appear above the Castle. They're
fireworks! The bursts hang in the sky for impossibly long minutes and
spell out the name &quot;Queen Vivienne&quot;.

Then a dragon appears, golden and beautiful. It begins to loop through
the frozen e's in the sky.

Then Castle Marrach explodes.

SCREAMS and SHOUTS arise from the crowd of Castle Dwellers, who all
begin to huddle together. One BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA's voice can be
heard above the DIN.

                         BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA
           My gowns! My chemises! My beautiful
           snoods!

The Beautifully Dressed Sera begins to SOB uncontrollably. No one
moves to comfort her.

                         SHANNON
           No need for alarm folks. Just a
           demonstration. No cats or rats were
           harmed in the making of this column.

Shannon SNAPS his fingers and Castle Marrach appears again,
unscathed. But somehow the viewer knows that the Beautifully's Dressed
Sera's snoods didn't make it.

The din QUIETS a little bit, but the crowd is now looking at Shannon a
bit suspiciously. The Watchmen are fingering their swords and looking
meaningfully at the nearby cliff.

                         SHANNON
                 (quickly)
           Alright everyone, thanks for your
           help in that demonstration, and why
           don't you go ahead and go home now.

Shannon SNAPS his fingers again and the whole crowd disappears with a
WHOOSH.

Shannon is now alone on Mount Arden, outside Castle Marrach. A cold
wind begins to whisper through his hair, just to add a little visual
interest to the scene.

                         SHANNON
           So remember that just by writing
           words you can create visuals as
           interesting as those in any movie ...
           your players' imaginations will fill
           in the rest.
                 (pauses)
           But, you can use a trick not
           available to the movies. You can
           appeal to the other senses too.

Shannon CLAPS his hand and a Special Dark candy bar appears. He
unwraps the candy and begins to eat it.

                         SHANNON
                 (in-between bites)
           Watching me eat this candy isn't
           really very effective, but in a prose
           game you can instead describe what it
           tastes like. Thus you can make just
           as powerful use of the other senses
           as you can sight.
                 (pauses)
           That's, uh, taste, smell, touch, and
           hearing.

Shannon nods sagely.

                         SHANNON
           Now, I seem to have gone over length
           again. My wife would say, &quot;What a
           surprise.&quot; In fact, she just did. So
           I'm going to draw this short and
           finish up next week.
                 (pauses)
           But first I'd like to summarize and I
           think the best place for that is the
           Skotos office.

This time Shannon blinks twice.

<u>INT. THE SKOTOS OFFICE - DAY</u>

Shannon's desk is covered with the typical detritus that comes with
the business world: paperwork. A laptop computer rises forlornly
amongst the papers, carbon copies, and triplicate forms.

Behind it, on the wall, is a whiteboard filled with an extremely long
todo list. Shannon gleefully erases it then picks up a black marker.

Shannon writes &quot;Marrach isn't the movies&quot;.

                         SHANNON
           So my global point this week is that
           Marrach isn't the movies, but that
           movies do unique things which Marrach
           StoryBuilders can learn from.

Shannon writes &quot;Movies are visual&quot;.

                         SHANNON
           And the first way in which Marrach
           and movies are different is that
           movies are very visual. But, you can
           balance that by making Marrach more
           visual too. 

Shannon writes &quot;1. Use gestures in conversations&quot;.

                         SHANNON
           By this I mean, don't just &quot;wryly
           say&quot;, but also replace words with
           gestures whenever you can. Think of
           what you'd really do in a live
           conversation.

Shannon writes &quot;2. Create big visualizations&quot;.

                         SHANNON
           You don't have a special effects
           budget, so don't be afraid to do big
           things.

Shannon writes &quot;3. Use the other senses too&quot;.

                         SHANNON
           And unlike movies--ignoring the short
           smell-o-vision craze--you can appeal
           to all of the senses, not just the
           eyes.

Shannon caps his pen and puts it down with a flourish.

                         SHANNON
           That's it for now. Next week, I want
           to talk about those other two topics
           ... how movies are discontinuous and
           how they're contained.
                 (pauses)
           And I'm afraid you're going to have
           to deal with this particular style of
           writing for another week ... a movie
           script descripting how Castle Marrach
           isn't a movie, that is. It ... amuses
           me.

Shannon reaches into the air and pulls out a a large trade
paperback. It's labeled &quot;Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud&quot;.

                         SHANNON
           You can blame this gentleman for the
           idea of my doing so. He's written two
           books about comic books using the
           medium of comics books to do so. The
           other one is called &quot;Reinventing
           Comics&quot;. Both highly recommended.

Shannon tosses the book onto his desk, resulting in a small explosion
of papers.

Shannon grimaces.

                         SHANNON
                 (waving)
           I'll see you back here in seven!
