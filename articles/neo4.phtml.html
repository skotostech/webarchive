            <h2>Labor-Saving Devices </h2>

<p><i> &quot;All the world's labor-saving devices,together, never  saved a minute of labor.&quot; -- Anon </i><p> In <ahref="neo2.phtml.html">aprevious  article</a>, I discussed how much prose is involvedwhen you're  writing an online text game.  There's a lot of it. In this article,  I'll talk about some methods of writing less, thoughthere's  <i>still</i> a lot to be done.  I call theselabor-saving methods  &quot;faking it&quot;, for reasons I'll explainlater in this  article. </p><h3> Saving Labor </h3><p> Four weeks ago, I talked about Data Inheritance. Data Inheritance  is explained in full detail in <a  href="TTnT_60.shtml.html">TT&T #60</a>  and <ahref="TTnT_20.html">TT&T  #20</a>.  I'll summarize the very basics as I go,but the articles  give a clearer explanation.  Read them if you havetrouble following  anything I say about inheritance. </p><p>  Data Inheritance saves you some text.  That'sbecause if you have  similar descriptions in a bunch of rooms, you canavoid writing each  one separately.  If you have a campus setting, forinstance, all  your outdoor locations could inherit from a singleparent object.  Each could automatically get grass, pebbles,walkways, views of  trees, city streets and academic buildings.  Allthose items and  descriptions could be details from the parent.  Thatprovides a nice  sense of uniformity: &quot;look!  I can see thechurch steeple from  the whole campus!&quot; It also saves you the workof adding that  description to every outdoor room on campus, orworse yet rewriting  similar things for each of those rooms. </p><p> There's a similar example in <a href="TTnT_61.shtml.html">TT&T#61</a>,  Shannon's &quot;Building Blocks: Example&quot;article.  Setting up  a default description for details is a very usefultrick, and can  save you a lot of writing or copying.  The sameexample shows how to  save even more effort on descriptions of exits usingSkotos Active  Markup -- you can substitute in a room'sdescription, right in the  exit description, so you don't have to describe itagain!  That's  how SAM, or similar procedural descriptions, cansave you effort and  help you write less text.  Even if you aren't usingthe Skotos  tools, it's a cute trick and you may be able to dosomething  similar with your own scripting environment. </p><p> Another trick is to keep a standard library ofobjects.  In  reality every wooden spoon is going to be slightlydifferent, but in  practice nobody cares.  Better yet, you can combinethis trick with  data inheritance to customize your mostly-stockobjects after the  fact.  It's usually better to deploy a game thatworks but isn't  utterly enthralling than to ask your fans (orcustomers!) to hold  off &quot;just a few more months&quot;.</p><p>  The same trick can make it easy to add customizationin the long  run.  You can replace the stock objects that youoriginally put in  place with an inherited version.  And by making theinherited  version different only cosmetically, you're makingyour debugging  much easier when you <i>do</i> change them.  It'seasy to keep  things the same with spoons, but harder with weaponsor gadgets  since you'll feel the urge to add to them, and aslightly different  child would <i>logically</i> have differentproperties.  Of course,  if you change them significantly then you're goingto have all the  same problems with player satisfaction and gamebalance that any  major change causes.  So keep it to customizingsmall stuff if  you're doing it after the fact.  And by inheritingfrom the original  object, you're making it easy to change very little.</p><h3> Rolling Dice </h3><p> The biggest Holy Grail of saving text, and themost misunderstood,  is procedural content generation.  The idea is thatyou can write  functions to set up your areas for you.  Those samefunctions could  write your descriptions for you from templates, andmaybe even build  the whole world.  Fans of procedural contentgeneration claim that  if you could do this really well that you'd neveragain have to  worry about hand-building anything.  They're abouthalf right. </p><p> Procedural content generation is really a sort ofsouped-up  version of the SAM trick above.  You write code toadd rooms or  write descriptions for you, saving you some headachedown the line.  You write a forest-room-description generator tostick sentences  together.  Sentences like &quot;there's a small,pleasant waterfall  here&quot; and &quot;birds sing in the berrybushes.&quot; The  problem is that if you use it that way, proceduralcontent is really  just a way to spread the same amount of writing eventhinner, just  like the SAM trick above.  The more territory youmake it cover, the  more uses of it seems predictable, badly-placed orboring.  I'll  cover that problem in more detail in a laterarticle.  But in the  end, you still have to write enough content to makeyour world  interesting.  Making it interesting is as much workwith procedural  content generation as it is without it, even if youget better  control over the size of the real estate. </p><h3> Faking It </h3><p> These methods all have certain things in common. Each of them, at  some level, takes static sentences or phrases andrepeats them.  The  SAM trick repeats room descriptions.  The standardlibrary trick  repeats object descriptions.  The data inheritancetrick repeats  detail descriptions.  The procedural content trickusually repeats  <i>all</i> of those descriptions, or at least allthat it can  generate.  This makes the world seem a little morerigid, and a  little less like a story you're being told.  Everytime a player  sees the same description again, they zone out andskip over it.  Repeating descriptions, especially large ones orfrequent ones,  deadens your players a little bit.  That's why theplayers turn on  'brief' mode and stop reading room descriptions. Repetition makes  them want to read less and skim more.  Repetitionmakes your game  less immersive and makes the players care less. </p><p> Players are, first and foremost, <i>people</i>. And to remain  creative and keep their minds active, people cravevariety and  interest.  Boredom is available from everytelevision and microwave  oven.  Don't make your game one more source of it. If you do then  people will rightly stay away. </p><p> Save text where you can, but make sure your gamefeels  <i>alive</i>. </p><h3> What's Next? </h3><p>  You may have noticed that this column tends toalternate social and  overview stuff with things that are more aboutbuilding and  implementation.  That's intentional, and I'mplanning to continue  that trend.  So in four weeks, expect to see moreabout procedural  content generation and spreading your builders' workthin.  In two  weeks, I'll talk a little about innovation andoriginality.  See you  in fourteen!</p>
