<I>Reality is over-rated, dear<BR>Don't let's be fooled by the hype<BR>There's no such thing as tomorrow, you hear -<BR>Amuse yourself, the time is ripe.<BR></I>Reality Song, <I><B>Evergreen Dayflies</I></B><P>When viewed objectively, the fact that the "realism" argument keeps comingup in these games would seem odd. Bringing realism into a discussion thatincludes fireballs, trolls, energy swords, blasters, and nanotechnology is,at first glance, totally out of place. Yet come up it does, over and over,and in the oddest contexts ("A *real* fireball would leave a smoke trail").Somehow, in spite of the obvious incongruities, we cannot escape from thebelief that reality is the default, and departures from it are suspect andprobably false.<P>Games are where people go to escape reality, so why the push to make it "real"?Because games have to ride the line between keeping our minds busy withfantasy, yet keeping it believable enough to keep our interest, to befun. When you go too real or too fantasy, the balance is lost and results ina game that has lost its spirit and isn't fun. So, often discussion aboutgames revolves around making them fun. And then things get ugly, becauseeveryone has very firm ideas about what is fun, and often those beliefsaren't accurate even for themselves. For some strange reason, like a zenkoan about the eye that cannot see itself, players can play a game, have fundoing so, but not really know why it is fun.<P>One key to the path out of this confusion comes from recentdevelopments in neuropsychology. What they are finding is the realfundamental workings of neural chemistry and firing that underlay theconscious and unconscious processes that we think of as "thinking". One isthat, although our minds are very plastic, they contain pre-dispositions,sort of a genetically derived "BIOS" that sets the initial conditions thatallow our minds to form. The brain wiring seems to contain certain hardwiredfunctions, and one of these is termed "intuitive physics", a part of ourbrain that, although not directly coded with knowledge of how real-worldphysical processes works, is built to gather and integrate data on thoseworkings and form them into a set of expectations. If there is anyhard-wired function in this, it is a simple drive to identify causality:Observable effects have identifiable causes, and we cannot help but look forthem. This tendency to identify causes for effects can get quite pronounced,such as the phase most children go through when they imagine profound ordire consequences from apparently innocuous actions. The roots ofsuperstition probably lie in trying to establish causes for otherwiseinexplicable observations. The desire to understand the ultimate causes ofthe world around us fuels both science and religion, this is a very powerfulinstinct we are talking about.<P>The other key comes from how the brain preserves neural pathways that provesuccessful at making predictions and suppresses those that fail. When weattempt something and succeed, we feel a rush of pleasure: endorphins,dopamine, and various hormonal and neurochemical effects encourage theneural connections that have just formed to be reinforced and optimized.When we attempt to reach a goal and fail, we feel frustration, shame, evenanger, and similar processes discourage the neural patterns that led to thecircumstances that created those feelings. When we have a successful patternof goal-seeking established, and something that changes the circumstances so thatthe pattern is no longer effective, we feel confusion, disorientation, evenfear, and a strong desire to re-establish the environment that fits ourearlier, successful, pattern.<P>Out of this, we may be able to extract an answer to one of the most vexingquestions in game design: What is fun? Fun is the process of establishing,seeking, and achieving goals, in a larger context that gives both theprocess and the results consistent meaning. Fun environments both surpriseand reassure us. They surprise us by working on rules that are verydifferent from those of the real world, and reassure us by having aninternal consistancy and logic that is reminiscent of that we find in thereal world. Realism is a constant theme, because the exemplar of theenvironment where these things can occur is the real one. The reason why themarket for trading real cash for in-game rewards will never be stamped outis because ultimately, they act as stand-ins for the same thing: Theunderlying desire to achieve goals.<P>
