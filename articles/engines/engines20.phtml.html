            <h2>The Rules </h2>
            <p><i><b>by Dave Rickey<br>

<I>This guy goes to the doctor, and tells him: "Doc, I think I have aserious allergy, I'm always wheezing and sometimes I break out in hives.You've got to find out what's wrong with me."<BR>So the doctor draws blood, orders a bunch of tests, and tells the guy tocome back after the results are in.  A few days later, the guy comes back tothe doctor's office to hear the results.  The doctor tells him; "You're ingreat health, we only found one allergy, and it's so unusual it shouldn't beany problem: You're allergic to elephant dung."<BR>"Doc, that's awful.  I work for a circus, I scoop up the elephant dung, I'maround the stuff all the time."<BR>"Well, you're extremely allergic to it, I think you should quit your job, dosomething else."<BR>"What, and give up show business?"</I><P>This was my sixth trip to E3, my first was the last one held in Atlanta in'98 (I didn't go in 2000).  The general rule is that your first E3 you'reblown away, the second you have fun, the third you're a little bored and bythe fourth you start to actively hate the experience.  That was pretty muchhow it went for me. After working the 2001 E3 as the overflow media contactfor Camelot, my knees felt like they were full of gravel, my throat feltlike it was lined with sandpaper, and if I never went back to LA, that wasfine with me.  The next year I disliked the whole circus.<P>By much the same token, between 2000 and 2003, I didn't enjoy playing videogames.  I couldn't turn off the urge to analyze them, I was too deeplyinvolved in judging the gameplay, art assets, and other attributes of thegames to enjoy simply playing them.<P>Both of those have changed recently.  As I found myself explainingrepeatedly at E3, this last few months have been a "personal growth period",after six years in which my life was defined by "work, eat, sleep, lather,rinse, repeat", I took a few months off to attend to my personal life, andreflect on things.  Other than these columns (the quality of which hassuffered), I was basically out of contact since January.  I've been takingthe time to consider the industry as a whole, and what my next step in mycareer would be.  Giving up "showbiz for geeks" was briefly considered, butrejected pretty quickly.  For a variety of reasons, I am a "true believer"in the potential of these games, and I couldn't walk away from them any morethen the infamous elephantine sanitation engineer.<P>More than that, however, I found that I could enjoy playing games again.Having turned off my analytical urge while I recovered a personal life, Ifound it wasn't so hard to turn it on and off on cue as I needed to in orderto enjoy the process of playing the game, then analyze it later.  And, forthe first time since 1999, I enjoyed going to E3, seeing new and upcominggames, chatting with the developers, and schmoozing at parties.  The onlyone I'll mention here is <i>Auto Assault</i>; everyone I spoke to either hated itor absolutely loved it, which will serve as my segue into the real focus ofthis column: The rules of MMOG development, as far as I have been able tofigure them out:<P><B>Rule #1: Embrace Your Niche</B><BR>There's been an ongoing debate in the industry over whether the "N" word wasthe kiss of death, or the One True Way.  I think that City of Heroes finallytipped the scales on this question: the key to success for an online game isto carefully define the niche you wish to serve, embrace it openly, andserve it well.  It is still a potential danger to over-refine your niche,but in general, unlike single-player games where you want to create a gamethat as many as possible will take off of the shelf and like just enough notto go through the hassles of returning, in online games you want to appealto a solid base of long-term subscribers who will pay the monthly fees andbuy the expansions; in other words it is not enough for them to like thegame, they must <B>love</B> the game.  With an overall market sizeapproaching 3 million subscriptions, and viable investment returns requiringa game to only capture 3-4% of that, it's entirely reasonable to pursue aconcept that will turn off 80% of the market, if the remaining 20% has astrong prospect of finding a game experience there they will like, andcannot find anywhere else.  The key will be to really deliver on the promiseimplied by the choice of niche (which City of Heroes does, and Auto Assaultappears to be poised to do).<P><B>Rule #2: The Market <I>is</I>the Hardcore</B><BR>This ties in with Rule #1, coming from the other direction.  Once the marketfor single player games was driven by the "Hardcore Gamer", people whobought a dozen games a year and routinely upgraded their computers severaltimes a year to play the latest and greatest.  These players had ever risingexpectations of quality in all areas, and these expectations drove the costsof developing games higher all through the 90's.  In the late 90's, theeconomics of this broke down: The few tens to hundreds of thousands thatwould buy games of certain genres because they were deeper, more complex,and more realistic, were no longer sufficient for it to be profitable to makethe games they demanded.  These players are our core market, they will payfor monthly subscriptions to get what they want and they aren't going to getit from the single-player developers anymore.  Our market will grow byconverting casual players into hardcore gamers, not through reaching out tothem by "dumbing down" our games.<P><B>Rule #3: No Honeymoons</B><BR>Technically flawed systems and severe customer service inadequacies may behallmarks of MMOG launches, but the market isn't willing to tolerate themanymore.  Several games have started off with strong sales, but sufferredtechnical issues that have caused conversion rates to drop through thefloor, and the games have never recovered.  UO and EQ may have had problemsas great or greater, but they had the advantage of a lack of alternatives,no game will ever have that luxury again.<P><B>Rule #4: Don't Forget the Game</B><BR>It's easy to get overwhelmed with the sheer scale and complexities of theprocess of MMOG development, and forget to put enough attention on the funparts.  No matter what your ambitions, or the subtleties of your endgame,you still have only minutes, at most an hour or so, to lock in theirinterest in the game.  The newbie experience must be smooth, polished, andcompelling.<P><B>Rule #5: Mindshare, Mindshare, Mindshare</B><BR>It is increasingly clear that games have only a few months to establishtheir subscriber base, which will then remain fairly stable for years tocome.  This means that "sleeper" hits are unlikely if not impossible in thisbusiness, and experience would indicate that the most effective tool in thebattle for mindshare is an evangelical developer, and in the future we'regoing to have some close variant on a "Star" system, where the name andreputation of high-profile designers is at a premium.  Major licenses<B>might</B> be adequate to the task of establishing initial mindshare,although it's doubtful they will do anything more for a title (it'squestionable which did more for SWG, the Star Wars liscense or Raph Koster'srecognition, but it's clear that the Star Wars name didn't pay off enough tobe worth it).<P><B>Rule #6: Everything is Simple</B><BR>Von Clausewitz observed that "In war, everything is very simple, but thesimplest thing can be very difficult."  This is also true in in MMOG's: eachof the steps required to go from concept to launch is very easily understoodand simple to perform, but the sheer number of steps and the inadequacy ofour understanding of their relative importance makes it extremely easy tomiss a step, or to approach it in the wrong manner.  As with rule #2, thetolerance of the market for these mis-steps is steadily declining, and theimportance of experience in and study of the process will grow.<P><B>Rule #7: You'll Get By With Help From Your Friends of Friends ofFriends</B>  <BR>No matter how much your invest in the quality of your graphics, the depth ofyour content, or the promotion of your game, in the end what keeps theplayers in the game is each other. In many cases, they have been playingwith the same friends for years, having migrated together across severalgames.  There is no acceptable reason to tell a player "No, you may not hangout with your friends."  Anti-powergaming measures that stratify the playersand pull apart groups of friends by not allowing them to group together arebad, and no justification for them stands up in the long term.<P><B>Rule #8: Players are Your Greatest Resource</B><BR>The average player puts 20 hours a week into the game.  This means that forevery 10,000 players, the equivalent of 100 man-years of time is expended<b>every week</b>, quickly turning into man-millenia per week for thesuccessful game.  Even at extremely low efficiencies, converting this effortinto entertainment value rapidly exceeds the input of your paid staff byorders of magnitude.  Beyond the first few hours of play, it is this hiddenresource that is really holding your players in your game.  No matter howhard you worked to create the world, the fact is your efforts are justbackground and context for the real attraction.  Get over yourself andfigure out how to make this work for you.<P><B>Rule #9: Guard Your World</B><BR>The power represented by Rule #8 can also work against you.  You have animplicit duty to protect your players from harassment, cheating, andexploitation, and if you fail to fulfill this duty you will lose revenue ata higher rate than the costs of enforcement.  Players will look for everyadvantage they can get, and some dozens to hundreds of them are going to beskilled programmers.  They will look for every bug and logical error in yourgame, use those ruthlessly, and then step beyond those into messing aroundwith your client and packet stream.  Do not trust obfuscation techniques orencryption; assume that any data that reaches the client is going to beeventually discovered and exploited.  Safeguarding the integrity of yourgame world is an ongoing process, from the initial design forward.<P><B>Rule #10: Perception is Reality</B><BR>Whether it is the comparative balance of one character development, theintegrity and quality of your customer service program, or anything else,the way your players perceive things is more important than how theyactually are.  In some cases it may be possible to educate the players...butonly if they perceive your statements as coming from a truthful source.<P>It's a terrible commentary on the state of the games industry as whole thatafter 6 years I qualify as a "grizzled veteran", able to dispense suchadvice with a straight face.  But that's the subject of a future column.For what it is worth, these are the most fundamental lessons and observatonsof my career, offered freely and worth what you're paying for them.
