<p><I>The moon be - longs to ev'ryone <BR>The best things in life are free. <BR></I><B>--<I>The Best Things In Life Are Free</I>, Dinah Shore, 1948<P></B><I>The best things in life are free<BR>But you can keep them for the birds and bees<BR>Now give me money<BR>That's what I want<BR>That's what I want, yeah<BR>That's what I want<BR></I><B>--<I>Money</I>, The Beatles, 1963</B><P>A recurrent subject in discussions of online games is the risk-aversion ofthe major projects and companies, their unwillingness to go outside ofproven formulas and try to bring totally new things into the market.  Thisis both true and false: True, because with budgets having reached 8 figures,there's a limit to how much risk can be accepted by responsible projectmanagement; False, because online games have been much more innovative inrecent years than single player games, and because the hold that establishedgames maintain on the market makes simply retreading established formulaseven more problematic and expensive than breaking new ground.<P>The fact is, there have been very few EverQuest clones to actually reach themarket (about three), and even fewer that have been sucessful (exactly one).The near future will see a couple more, with budgets that exceed that of theoriginal by a factor of 5.  It's not hard to clone EQ, there's only onelittle problem: The original refuses to go away and turn loose thosecustomers.  In single player games, a clone (or sequel) can always hope tosell to some subset of the market that liked the original game, and wants anew episode with similar gameplay and setting.  In some cases, the cloneshave reached beyond that, and eclipsed the progenitor as the defining gameof their niche.<P>That can happen to an extent with online games: EQ was in the eyes of themarket a very similar product to Ultima Online.  After all, they were bothfantasy-based OLRPG's with dragons, magic spells, and the other traditionalD&D-inspired trappings; to an outsider the only significant differences areEQ's first-person viewpoint vs. UO's isometric overhead.  But while UOestablished the MMO market, EQ defined it, growing to twice the size of UObefore significant competition appeared.  The most telling observation isthat the first games to appear and seriously challenge EQ were bothdifferent in ways that even those outside of the established playerbasecould appreciate: One (Anarchy Online) was a sci-fi setting, and the other(Dark Age of Camelot) had an emphasis on PvP.  This established what Ibelieve will be an invariant rule of MMOG's that stands in stark contrast tosingle-player game development: Differentiate, or don't bother (AnarcyOnline's technical issues crippled it after launch, but its initial saleswere quite good).<P>Single player "market builders" come out of nowhere, turn into huge hits,and then get out of the way; even their sequels are just clones with namerecognition and a leg up.  Online games don't get out of the way. Once acertain setting, assembly of gameplay, and basic technology gets a grip on asegment of the market, they will hold it until a failure to adapt allowssomeone else to chip away part or all of it.  The only advantage thenewcomers have is a clean slate, which they can only capitalize on byinnovating.  Nonetheless, how much innovation to embrace will remain thethorniest problem in MMO design for quite some time to come.  A failure toinnovate will guarantee market irrelevance and failure, while over-reachingand excessive ambition will result in death march projects that never quitemanage to reach launch.  And with budgets continuing to inflate, the stakesare high.<P>Offset against the big budgets are equally big potential payoffs, EverQuestis the highest-grossing computer game ever.  The Sims franchise is #2, UO #3(and Myst #4).  Some would point out that UO and EQ have requiredconsiderably more to develop and operate then The Sims, but once you factorin marketing and development budgets for The Sims and over a dozenexpansions the numbers are probably in the same ballpark.<P>One question I've seen asked in several different places is "How do youmanage to spend so much money making these games?"  In one word: Payroll.Building worlds is a labor-intensive process.  You can license yourengines, buy your hardware off the shelf, build your architecture around OSScomponents, but you can't create a new and interesting world and fill itwith detail without a lot of artists and world builders.  Algorithmiccontent generation can improve their productivity, but there's no substitutefor hand craftmanship.<P>Here's a <a href="eoc-gamecost.xls">spreadsheet</a> for a budget to make an MMO.  It'sslightly modified from the one I was using as part of pitch earlier thisyear.  Around 90% of the projected budget is personnel related costs.Salaries, insurance, office furniture, PC's, it all adds up. By launch day,the burn rate is around half a million dollars a month (and at that, Ishorted the Customer Service department, what is in the plan would onlycover about 50,000 players).  But if you start analyzing it, it becomespretty clear that the expense comes in four phases:<P>Phase 1 is server prototyping and architecture development.  In my plan,this is a *long* stage, close to two years.  In the typical project, it'smuch shorter, if it exists at all.  Usually, the client, server, and contentare being developed on parallel tracks at the same time, with the ostensiblepurpose of minimizing development time.  In fact, the real motivation comesfrom the milestone-driven structure of the normal development project.  Insuch a structure, a "playable demo" usually comes pretty early.  This seemsperfectly logical from the viewpoint of those putting up the money: theywant to see something produced for all the money they are putting in.Unstated, but usually implicit in getting milestones signed off andadditional funds invested is that the playable demo also be reasonablypretty, in fact it's more important for it to be pretty than for it toreally be playable.<P>There are three problems with this: Once you start producing art andbuilding the world, you have to commit to a technological target, yourmodels, textures, and the graphics engine are going to have to be aimed at acertain level of graphics capability, so the clock is ticking, miss yourtech window by too much and your game is going to look out of date;<b>And</b> once you start hiring artists your burn rate goes through theroof, which means that the money is going to run out a lot sooner;<b>And</b> the area of development with the most potentially seriousunpredictable delays is server development, if you hit a roadblock there andpushing off the launch date is not an option (and if your payroll is fullystaffed up, it won't be), your only choice is to start cutting features (andbecause world-building and tools development may wind up delayed in startingby server snafus, this can lead to ripple effects that can send the wholeproject into a tailspin).<P>This is why I would <b>strongly</b> suggest that the industry as a wholeneeds to take a page from NCSoft and stop trying to make things pretty soearly in the development cycle.  Develop your server, develop your tools, doall of this early on in the process when your costs are comparatively lowand you can afford to do it right.<P>Phase 2 of the process is where most people have been starting.  The clientprogrammers and the core of the art team is brought on board, and somethingthat actually looks like a game starts to get built.  This gets integratedwith the server (in the traditional process, the server is still being builtat fundamental levels and frequently this need to support and integrate withthe client is driving the priorities there).  After this is nearly complete,tools are developed for content development (again, in the normal processtools are lashed together to meet the needs of the playable demo, thenminimally improved for use in the production pipeline because the press oftime demands it).<p>Phase 3 is where most of the money gets spent. Lots of artists and worldbuilders are brought on board, the gameplay features are finalized andgrossly balanced (fine tuning balance is a never-ending process that willextend well past launch).  At this point you are committed to a launchwindow only a few months wide.<p>Phase 4 is the final run up to launch.  Servers are purchased andconfigured, betas are run, bugs in all content and systems are discoveredand fixed.  For the typical project, this stage never really happens, but isinstead overlaid on Phase 3, with the result that in the crush to finish thegame only the most severe bugs get fixed, if you're lucky.<P>For the first 2 years of this hypothetical project, expenses arecomparatively low, but there's comparatively little to show to those withoutthe background to evaluate strictly technical progress.  Companies andinvestors that are used to the usual single-player development cycle caneither accept this and adjust their plans, or they can continue to try tobuild MMOG's the way that single player games are built, and they cancontinue to fail.<P>
