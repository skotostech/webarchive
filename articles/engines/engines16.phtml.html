<p><I><B> No matter where you go, there you are.</B><BR>--Dr. Buckaroo Banzai</I><P>Well, I find myself preparing for another pilgrimage to San Jose, center ofthe universe for all things digital, to attend GDC and give a presentationfor the second MUD-Dev Conference.  It's been an ... interesting year.  Lastyear this time I was working for Mythic. Since then I've left there, takenand lost a job as Lead Designer for another company, and embarked on theexcercise in frustration that is trying to raise capital to do my ownproject from scratch in a market that is no longer "hot".  Meanwhile, theindustry seems to be still trying to answer the same question they've beenasking for 4 years: What's next?<P>The industry is trapped in a cul-de-sac, repackaging the EQ gameplay model indifferent ways and different settings.  Efforts to step out of that modelhave failed, one after the other.  Even the great hope to break the mold andget into the mass market, Star Wars Galaxies, in the end became "justanother treadmill".  It's looking more and more like the treadmill is not atemporary stepping stone on our way to something better, but something coreand fundamental that we are always going to have to work around.  Eventhough I've been saying that for the last few years, I wouldn't have mindedturning out to be wrong<P>I'm basing this statement on more than just the empirical evidence of thegames we have seen.  Lately I've been reading up on neuro-psychology and therelated fields.  There's been a lot of progress in that area in the lastdecade, we're starting to approach a reductionist explanation for the mind.Core to any explanation of mental processes is the means by which neuralconnections express behaviour and retain memory.  The "science of the mind"is actually becoming worthy of the name.<P>At the core of this process is the way that we learn.  To grosslyoversimplify, mental networks that yield desirable results are reinforced,those that yield undesirable results are inhibited.  We "feel" this invarious ways, pleasurable ones for reinforcement, uncomfortable ones forinhibition.  When we set up our games to contain behavioristic "variablereward, variable ratio" systems, we're tapping into one of the fundamentalsystems the brain uses to evaluate success or failure in coping with theworld.  Possibly, in a way similar to our collective over-indulgence inrefined sugar, this repeated triggering of a fundamental reward evaluationcan lead to extreme, even pathological behaviors (I'm not speaking so muchof the "catass effect" here as the self-destruction of compulsive gambling,which is an even more extreme example of the same pathology).<P>The "perform action, receive reward" reinforcement system is to learningwhat sugary sweets are to eating: Pleasurable, but ultimately pointless andpotentially damaging.  However, we are capable of learning to appreciatemore complex flavors than simple sweets, so if the analogy is to be trustedthere should be more complex forms of pleasure that we can induce throughgameplay.  This begs the question: What are they?<P>Well, re-evaluated in this context, the community-formation aspects of thesegames takes on a new meaning; it's tying into our sense of social position,our need to know our role in society.  This would seem to be qualitativelydifferent and more subtle than the "ding" rush of the action-reward pleasuresystem.  Another would be the exploration drive; we seem to derive pleasurefrom being the first to discover a new place or a new subtle property orinteraction of the game systems.  All of these map directly to fundamentalbrain-reward systems.<P>On the reverse, now the real issue with death penalties becomes clearer, it's not simply the lack of success, but the declaration of failure andconsequent penalization that triggers the same mental processes associatedwith shame, frustration, and humiliation, intended to discourage behaviors thatlead to undesirable consequences.  These systems are intended to push us toidentify the sequence of actions and desires that led to failure, anddiscourage us from engaging in the same actions or pursuing the samedesires.<P>From a psychiatric viewpoint, these observations are rather obvious andpedestrian, but from a game-design viewpoint they have wider implications.Of the greatest significance are the implications for the role of thetreadmill: Necessary, but not adequate, and the potential they raise formoving beyond the cumulative-character reward systems through careful studyof neuro-psychiatric research.  If there's a way out of this trap we'vefound ourselves in, it will almost certainly have to come from providingpleasures more subtle and interesting than those of a slot machine or apinata.
