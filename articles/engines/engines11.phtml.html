            <h2>Pursuit of Knowledge </h2>

<p><I>Knowledge without know-how is sterile. We use the word "academic" in apejorative sense to identify this limitation. <BR><b>Myron Tribus</b><P>We learn from history that we do not learn from history. <BR><b>Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel</b></I><P>When I first got into this business 5 years ago, I had a lot of catching upto do. Fortunately, so did a lot of other people; at the time all of thepeople with experience in designing online games could fit into a singleroom, and it wouldn't take a very big one. Even more fortunately, many ofthem (including <a href="../bth.html">JessicaMulligan</a>, <ahref="http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2003/features/20030306/olsen_01.htm">Gordon Walton</a>, <href="http://www.neardeathstudios.com/NDS-Team.shtml">BrianGreen</a>, <ahref="http://www.igda.org/breakingin/profile_damion_schubert.htm">DamionSchubert</a>, and <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/">RaphKoster</a>) were going out of their way to share their knowledge. And I ambeginning to understand how frustrating that was for them, as they offeredadvice freely that could have saved many of those MMO projects out there atthe time, only to see it rejected, ridiculed, or just plain ignored. At anygiven time since Ultima Online broke the market open, there have been inexcess of 100 MMO projects in development. There were 100+ when EQ launched,there were 100+ when AO, WW2O, and Camelot launched, and there are 100+ now.Nearly all of those projects will fail.<P>That's a mathematical certainty; if more than a small percentage of them didnot fail the market wouldn't be big enough to absorb them. But unfortunatelyfor the players and the industry, that won't be the cause of failure formost of them. The vast majority of them will be stillborn, dead before themarket ever hears of them. Most because their ambitions exceed their moneysupply, more because their ambitions exceed their knowledge. It isn't somuch that making MMO's is hard, in fact each of the steps needed to make anMMO is fairly straightforward and solvable by anyone reasonably bright. Butthere are an incredible number of steps, and they all have to be taken inpretty much the right order. More than that, there are a lot of perfectlylogical mistakes to be made, mistakes that only a careful study of historywill explain the fallacies of. Without that study, the development processcan be led down a dead-end path that can add months to the developmentcycle, or possibly sink it completely.<P>But the Old Guard is getting tired of explaining these things over and over,and not enough are coming forward to take their place. This column has beenpart of my trying to repay that--sharing what I have learned with the nextcycle of those out to learn this trade. And along the way, I've beenstudying the cycle by which ideas become common knowledge. Recently, I'vebeen active in commenting on entries at the <ahref="http://terranova.blogs.com/">Terra Nova blog</a>, for much the samepurpose as I imagine those I named above had for going to the forums of thelate Lum The Mad's and <ahref="http://www.waterthread.org/">Waterthread</a>. That blog representssomething new, however, because it's focus is not simply that of playersspeaking with a few developers brave enough to face their wrath, but insteadit is mostly academics, commenting on what they find noteworthy about thegames and the communities they foster.<P>Sometimes the debates are covering old ground, for example yet anotherrehash of the practice of playing a character of a different gender thanyour own, aka "cross-dressing". One of the characteristics of receivedknowledge reaching out into new circles of community is that it getschallenged, rethought, re-justified. But this time is different, what hasbecome obvious common knowledge about social gameplay design is starting toconfront, and in some cases to directly contradict, well-established schoolsof socio-political thought. So far, this has only been noticed by a handfulof researchers who are not yet being taken all that seriously by theacademic mainstream. That can't last, and I actually feel a degree ofconcern about what is going to happen when the mainstream does notice.<P>Hopefully the readers will pardon me, but I'm going to have to go pretty farafield from game design in this week's column, into territory that I onlydimly understand. In essence, I'm going to be describing a brewing civil warwithin the ranks of academia, which online game design may find itselfcaught up in. In essence, the problem comes from two great splits in theapproach to the pursuit of knowledge, one old and one new.<P>The old one is the classic split between the "hard sciences" such asphysics, chemistry, and biology, and the "soft sciences", psychology,sociology, and other fields sometimes referred to as the "humanities". Itarises from the inadequacies of mathematics in supplying strong models thatare capable of providing rigorous explanatory or predictive value wherehuman behaviour is concerned. Even economics, the "hardest" and mostmathematically pursued of the humanities, offers nowhere near the same kindof mechanistic, "reductionist", repeatable systems that underlie even thesoftest of the hard sciences, Biology. As a result, the pursuit of thesefields has focused on scholarship, the accumulation and organization ofobservations.<P>For a long time, the general approach to these sciences has been to chooseyour politics, and then organize the observations to support the conclusionthat your politics were inevitable. Ideology underlies almost every theoryabout how human cultures form and evolve, and the ideologues are definitelyaware that the fundamental nature of human beings is critical to the successor failure of the political structures they find desirable. It is thisprocess of fitting facts to theory that led to a very definite view of humannature, society, and art known collectively as "post-modernism".Post-modernism has at its core the idea that there is no inherent humannature, that people are at least in potential infinitely plastic and becomewhat they are shaped to be. This means that any standard of beauty, justice,or even of truth is not absolute, but only a result of "consensus reality",the common agreement to treat certain things as true. This is essential toany ideology that depends on a populace that is not motivated by personalgain, or is centered on redressing some classical inequality; it was thedirect source of the logic behind the infamous "re-education" programs ofcommunist nations through the middle part of the last century.<P>In the interest of fairness, the opposite view, that human nature is whollydeterminant and inflexible, built into our genes, was the fundamentalassumption of the "Natural Order" arguments that underlay fascism, and wasthe direct source of the logic behind the "Final Solution". So these arepowerful forces we're dealing with--arguments of religious intensity thathave proven in the past to be capable of leading to atrocities.<P>The new split is, in a way, actually a merger (or perhaps a hostiletakeover). The split between the humanities and the sciences isn'tcompletely sharp: some disciplines in each camp study the same things fromdifferent directions. For example, anthropology and sociology studyindividual and group behaviours from the humanities, evolutionary biologyand ethology study them from the sciences. For a long time, the inadequacyof the analytical tools kept them from treading on each others toes, eachside pursued its own theories by its own methods, and pretty much ignoredthe other; an invisible wall of jargon and differing scopes of inquiry keptthem apart. In the 90's that wall started to break down, largely as a resultof increases in computing power allowing the sciences to gather and integratemuch larger amounts of data, and to a limited extent to test rigoroustheories <I>in silico</I>, that is by simulating them inside of a computer.This led to what eventually became known as the "Science Wars", a fightinside the halls of academia about how science should be done when itconcerned human behaviour. In essence, evolutionary biologists starteddemonstrating rigorous proofs of how evolution and genetics could affect andbe affected by behavioural interactions, and their results seemedincompatible with post-modernism, upsetting the underpinnings of manyideologies in much the same way that Gallileo's disproving of Aristotleancosmology undermined the theology of the Catholic church. E. O. Wilson andRichard Dawkins were at the forefront of this effort, and the subsequentevents were documented in <ahref="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0192862154/qid=1066797830/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-1499283-4815341?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Defendersof the Truth</a> by Ullica Segerstrale in far more detail than I would beable to go into here. In truth, the "Science Wars" are not over, but simplyin a state of armistice.<p>The other piece of the new split is known as "Emergence". Emergence is anoutgrowth of Complexity theory, which is itself a product of Chaos theory(originally the province of some very obscure and theoretical mathematics,the best known of which are fractals like the <ahref="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/julia/explorer.html">Mandelbrotset</a>). In essence, emergence relies on the ability of interacting agentsoperating on very simple rules to display extremely complex observedbehaviour, particularly when this behaviour can look both chaotic andorganized in ways that cannot be predicted simply by studying the behaviourof the agents in isolation. This is important because it allows problems tobe defined and solved that are simply inaccessible to the mathematicalmethods that have been the backbone of the hard sciences, and with equalrigor. The most comprehensive work on emergent systems is <ahref="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579550088/qid=1066798731/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-1499283-4815341">A new Kind of Science</a> by StephenWolfram, which is either the most significant work of fundamental sciencesince Newton's calculus--or the world's most egregious case ofself-publishing by a crackpot ever (I lean towards the first, myself). Theapplicability of emergence to certain problems is undeniable; the largerquestion of its ability to provide answers from mathematically intractablefields like human behaviour is still a subject of great debate. The methodsof Dawkins and Wilson are definitely emergent in character.<P>So a great deal of bound up tension is seething (by academic standards) justunder the surface, and online games have the potential to trigger itsrelease. Out of neccessity, we've had to start developing and testingtheories of human social behaviour based on behaviouristic psychology andemergent principles, and worse yet from the viewpoint of post-modernism,some of our theories appear to be working. This has the potential to makethe great "D&D is a snare of Satan" debates of the 80's look like a teaparty--at least then our opponents were barely coherent under the best ofcircumstances, and unable to get anyone besides a few of the more extremechristian sects worked up, and the media coverage was nearly as critical andridiculing of them as it was of the gamers. The people we're about to setoff have decades of experience at the cut-and-thrust of academic politicaldebate, impeccable credentials, and an agenda we won't even comprehend.<P>Don't get me wrong, I look forward to the work of academia on studying theseworlds. There's so much to be learned here, and someone caught up in tryingto build them simply can't hope to have time to study them in any depth.We're going to need these academics, with their effectively infinite focusand lack of fiscal pressures, if we're ever going to figure out what's goingon in here, and it is entirely possible that what they will learn will throwlight onto problems of literally world-shaking importance. But I have astrong suspicion that things are going to get <b>ugly</b>.  E.O. Wilson wasutterly perplexed that conclusions drawn from observations of insectbehaviour would lead to student demonstrations complete with signs labellinghim a fascist.  A few years from now, we may find ourselves equallyvillified, and equally confused how trying to make better games could setoff such a firestorm.<P>
