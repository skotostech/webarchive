<h3>Or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Uberguild</h3><P><I>Give me the fruitful error any time, full of seeds, bursting with its owncorrections. You can keep your sterile truth for yourself. <BR><B>--Vilfredo Pareto</I></B><P>One of the thorniest problems in online game design is how to deal withcreating an environment where the "casual player" and the "power gamer" canco-exist.  There's an implicit belief in the principle of "fairness", thatwhat Average Joe gets for his monthly subscription is the same as everyoneelse, that if the powergamers are extracting more reward and playing morehours, it somehow devalues the game experience of the less obsessive.<P>This tempest in a teapot is the constant refrain of board warriors, with anever-ending list of reasons why those who have to work for a living(apparently with unmonitored internet access) cannot and should not beexpected to compete with children and college students who can spend so muchmore time playing.  However, this debate never goes anywhere, and the reasonwhy is because it's all strawmen.<P>In any field of human endeavour, where the performance of people is rankedagainst each other, you quickly run into something called a "power law"relationship.  The classic form of this is commonly known as the "80-20Rule", where 20% of the participants in any activity will perform 80% of the work, and/or get 80% of the reward.  The original form ofthis was the "Pareto Principle", the observation that 20% of the people held80% of the wealth.  Since then, it has been extended to many other areas,for example if a carpenter owns 100 tools, he probably uses only 20 of themfour fifths of the time.<P>Unsurprisingly, similar effects turn up in online games when examiningplayer behaviour, XP-earning rates, PvP success ratios, and so on.  If theaverage XP per hour of play for 40th level characters is 1,000,000xp, thetop half of them will be found to be earning at some multiple of that rate.What makes this significant is that pareto-optimized environments arerecursive; if the top half of the playerbase is earning at 1.5 times theoverall average, the top half of the half (25%) will be earning at 1.5 times*that* rate, or 2.25 times the overall average.  In a "fair" environment,this process continues, the top 12.5% will be earning at 2.25 * 1.5 = 3.375the overall rate. Carry this logic out to its logical conclusion, and in asufficiently large population of players (tens of thousands), you shouldfind that a small number of them are earning XP at a rate hundreds of timesthat of the "average" player.  In fact, most players are *below* average,the high-performers at the top inflate the average to well beyond that ofthe performance by the majority.  This would be nothing but a theoreticalcuriousity, if examining the performance of actual players in actual gamesdidn't correspond strongly with the theory.<P>How is it possible that in a "fair" system, the majority of players willactually receive below-average results, and a minority will rake in a hugeamount of the reward?  It's actually fairly easy to set up a thoughtexperiment to demonstrate this, but first I need to explain one more bit oftheory: the normal distribution, also known as the "Bell Curve", which mostof you should be familiar with from high-school statistics.  Basically, whenmeasuring the performance of humans against *absolute* standards, they showa characteristic pattern, with the majority of them performing at or nearthe average value, a handful performing well above, and a correspondinghandful performing equally below the average.  And individuals on multipletrials will often show this same distribution, sometimes outperforming theirpersonal average and other times underperforming, but clustering to somedegree around their average.<P>So, for our thought experiment, let's take 2 4-sided dice.  There are 7possible results from rolling these dice, from 2 to 8, and the chances of each result are arrayed in a bellcurve, from one chance in sixteen of a 2 or 8to four chances in sixteen of getting a 5.  To represent differing skilllevels, we'll fall back on that old pencil-and-paper standby: The modifier.Our hypothetical players will be Maximum Mike with a +1 modifier, AverageJoe and his twin Average Jim with no modifier, and Special Ed with a -1modifier.  So we have three bellcurves (one of them duplicated in ourpopulation so it also forms a bell curve).<P>For our first ruleset, we'll assume that rolling a 6 or better is a winninground, an objective standard that will represent a purely PvE contest, whereplayers never compete directly.  In this case, we'll find that Special Ed"wins" 3 times in 16 (18.75%), Average Joe and Jim "win" 6 times in 16(37.5%), and Maximum Mike "wins" 10 times in 16 (62.5%).  So in ourobjective measure of a game with minimal "skill", everyone but Maximum Mikeis below the average "win" rate (39.0625%), and Special Ed's small (12.5%)performance penalty has resulted in a huge shortfall in results (less than1/3 the win rate of Maximum Mike and exactly half that of the Averagetwins).<P>What we have here is essentially a mathematical proof that "Life isn'tfair", something most of us figure out empirically by the time we are 12years old.  But what if the opponent is more personal? Instead of a "win"involving beating an objective score, let's pit the players against eachother, one on one: The one with a higher roll wins, ties are ignored.  Wecan predict the overall win ratios for each potential matchup by taking eachpotential roll of one contestant, calculating the chance that their opponentwill roll higher, multiplying that by the chance of the potential roll, andsumming all possible potential rolls.  Each one of our players has threepotential opponents.<P>Sparing you the math, Special Ed will win 35.8% of his rounds (assumingequal numbers against each possible opponent), 41.4% against Average Joe andJim, 25.8% against Maximum Mike.  Average Joe and Average Jim will get 50%against each other, 58.6.2% against Special Ed, and 41.4% against MaximumMike (which becomes a wash of 50% overall).  Maximum Mike wins 64.2%overall.  This doesn't *seem* unfair....  But if we change our scenarioslightly to include chips that transfer from loser to winner, and an overalwin objective of getting all the chips, then barring a small number of chipsand a bad run of luck, Maximum Mike will almost always win (if the number ofchips exceeds 10, Mike will win well over 90% of the time).  If all fourroll simulataneously, Special Ed will win less than 10% of the time, andMaximum Mike more than 35% (and Mike's victory in the chips version becomeseven more assured).<P>In actual games, over a significant length of time, players skill among thepopulation stops being distributed along a bell curve.  The bottom end ofthe curve drops out (literally, players who lose more than they win quitafter shorter periods of time).  As they do so, the remaining players fromthe bottom half the curve have increasingly poor peformance and themselvesdrop out, in an accelerating feedback pattern.So very small changes in overall performance can make very big differencesin overall result, depending on how the contests are set up.  The questionbecomes: How much of a factor is personal skill, how wide is thedistribution in performance?  The more of a factor the personal skill of theplayer is, the faster the dropout rate.<P>The conclusion we can draw from this is that there are sound psychologicaland mathematical reasons for the de-emphasis of personal skill in thesegames, and any efforts to build MMO's around personal-skill based gameplayneed to account for these.<P>However, it is impossible to completely remove personal skill from thesegames, and there is an inherent risk of acclerating the dropout rate throughreflexive game adjustments.  Let's say, for example, that we decide thatMaximum Mike's 10/16 success rate in the PvE scenario is too high, and toslow him down we change the "win" threshold to 7.  Now Special Ed "wins"only 1 in 16, Average Joe and Jim 3 in 16, and Maximum Mike still wins 6 in16.  The risk of "locking out" the less effective player while trying toslow down the extreme performer is a real one.<P>
