<p> Building online text games is a big undertaking. Laurel Stuart  talks about it in <a href="trenches07.shtml.html">&quot;BeA  God With Me</a>.  Shannon Appelcline talks about itin <a href="TTnT_65.shtml.html">TheWilderness  of Your Intuition</a>.  Let's look at just how big,and how that  compares to writing books or stories. </p><p> Skotos originally said that building a game likeCastle Marrach  was like writing a novel.  Jeff Crook said it waslike writing a  novel if you'd never written one before.  That makesa lot of sense.  You don't just need to write that much good prose,you need to  figure out a whole new genre. </p><p> Wait a minute.  Write that much prose?  But aGrand Theater is  only 30-50 rooms, right?  If that's your reaction,you're probably  used to the usual set of free MUDs, MUSHes or MOOs.</p><h3> Objects are Big </h3><p> If you've read Shannon's Building Blocks articlesor played some  Castle Marrach, you know that objects in CastleMarrach have long,  well-written descriptions.  You may also havenoticed that they have  lots of details.  Each detail is a sub-object withits own  properties.  This means that for every object yousee in a room,  there's a lot going on underneath. </p><p> Let's do a little math. </p><p> Shannon's Building Blocks articles have an exampleobject or two.  An example sword might have hilt, pommel and bladeas details.  For  the sword, that's a little more than a page of text. It has simple  descriptions for the details, half-line descriptionsof feel and  taste and whatnot, and a few lines for the gameabout what you can  or can't do to it.  An example anvil might have ahardy hole, a  pritchell hole, a base, a flat top, a horn, andmaybe a couple of  related bits.  The anvil is probably about threepages of text when  you include the details. </p><p> I'm measuring pages of text because we want tofind out just how  'big' a task it is to create a Skotos-sized textgame. </p><h3> There are a Lot of Them </h3><p> A room like a large kitchen might have over fiftyassorted  objects.  Cutting boards, knives, spoons, chef'shats...  Remember  that a real-life kitchen will have far more thanthat.  An in-game  blacksmith shop probably has an anvil, severaldifferent kinds of  hammers, straw on the floor, chisels, tongs, and thedetails of the  shack -- at least ten or fifteen various objects. Also, remember  that some objects, like the anvil, will have theirown  sub-details. </p><p> Let's say a good room should have about fifteenobjects that are  specific to it, and an object is about two pages oftext.  So a room  should be about thirty pages.  That means one roomwill require as  much raw prose as a short story.  Ten high-qualityrooms would be a  small novel.  And that 40-room Grand Theater, ifmost rooms were as  interesting as a kitchen or a smithy, would be thesize of &quot;The  Lord of the Rings&quot;.  That's if you make noobjects with fun  coded behaviors, and if your game engine alreadydoes absolutely  everything you want it to. </p><h3> How People Fake It </h3><p> If you're used to the world of free MUDs, you maybe scoffing.  You've seen huge worlds, hundreds or thousands ofrooms, which  certainly didn't take a decade to build.  But thinkabout quality:  most of those rooms probably have about four linesof description  and <i>no</i> further details.  In other words,every six rooms or  so is a single page of text.  A 600-room world isabout a hundred  pages.  So a 600-room world made of bare, sparserooms takes about  the effort of three of the full-quality rooms above. That's why you  see so many MUDs with thousands of rooms, only a fewhundred unique  objects, and no details (or local equivalent) atall. </p><p> Everybody fakes it somewhat.  You don't want tohave to write  Tolkien's life work for the next Castle Marrach.  Sonot every room  really has twenty unique objects.  Not every objectis an anvil.  Castle Marrach avoids having more than a fewportable objects,  partly to save all that building (remember thekitchen?).  Mainly,  it's important to make sure that common descriptionscan be re-used.  Data inheritance, a library of common objects,Skotos Active Markup,  even cut and paste -- do everything you can toreduce the amount of  text you have to write.  If doing all those thingssaves you thirty  percent of the writing you'd do otherwise, that maystill be  hundreds of pages.  And that means it's well worthspending some  programmer time to save some writer time.  Skotoshas already made  those optimizations.  If you use their engine thenyou get those  optimizations, which is one reason to send your gameproposals to  Skotos instead of writing it yourself.  If, instead,you're building  your own game engine, it's a reason to study Skotoscarefully. </p><p>  In a future column (I'm thinking four weeks) I'lltalk about these  labor-saving contrivances.  And you can read a <a  href="TTnT_60.shtml.html">past column  </a> or <a href="TTnT_20.html">two</a>of  Shannon's about data inheritance to prepareyourself, if you haven't  already.</p><p>  In the mean time, remember the basic math.  If youwant good,  powerful descriptions and really complex settings,be prepared to  write thirty pages of text for every room.  Some ofthe Skotos  projects have given rules of thumb like &quot;fourto five hours for  every room&quot;, and now you know why.  So beprepared to work  hard, or to cut corners.  Also, be sure you knowwhat the most  important parts of your setting are.  Since you nowknow you'll have  to cut corners <i>somewhere</i> it's important toknow where you  should absolutely <i>not</i> take the easy way out.</p><p>  Next, we'll follow up on current MUD codebases andhow they're  licensed.  See you in two weeks!</p>
