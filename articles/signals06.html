							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Here we are again.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">I've told you about the Arcana, those doomed souls who, cursed as werewolves, organized along the lines of the Tarot to fight against the true forces of evil.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">I've talked to you about the idea behind this particular take on the werewolf legend. I've talked to you about the symbolism of the Tarot, and how this applies to the Arcana's structure.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">But, how will this be translated into an online game?</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">I've been giving it some thought, and it seems that the game works best (at least in its current incarnation) as a series of one-off stage, rather than a Grand Theatre. As was pointed out on the forums (and please, join in the discussion, it's pretty cool over there!), given the immortality of the werewolves, the game could be either modern or historical. It was a concept that I hadn't considered (one of the great things about the forums, in fact... talking to people who can give me an outsider's look at the process).</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">This got me thinking. I mulled it over, and thought of a new approach. A series of self-contained stages, set at various times in history, featuring the same characters (at least those that survive from game to game) would be a great way for the players to become a part of the history of the game world. Each game could be set at a different time, and, upon the closing of that game, the timeline would advance to another time period, and pick up with the same characters.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Each game would need to take place at a contained location as well. This is not a problem, since the Arcana organize to fight against incursion by the forces of evil (more on these next week, come to think of it). It would be a simple matter to have each Stage of the game take place at a different location: a small village, or a modern skyscraper, or even a lonely, wind-swept castle (wait, that's been done, hasn't it...).</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">So, each Stage would spotlight the clash between the Arcana and the Enemy at a particular location at a particular time. As the situation is resolved, the Stage comes to a close. The host awards those surviving players with increased status or ability, and we move on to the next Stage.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Eventually, the plan would be to move Arcana on to become a Grand Theatre, but right now, I'll be damned if I can figure out a way to accomplish this. But, as with all things, it will work itself out in the fullness of time.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Next week, as promised, I will finally give you a look at the other side of the coin: the forces that stand arrayed against the Arcana. We're going to stare unflinchingly into the face of true evil.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Sounds like fun, doesn't it? See ya in 7.</font></p>
