Ever since I first got exposed to this industry, there's been an ongoingstruggle over how to define what is and is not a "Beta" for a game.Theoretically, there is a definition already, this version taken from TheFree On-line Dictionary of Computing:<P><I><B>Beta</B><BR>/bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n. 1. Mostly<BR>working, but still under test; usu. used with `in': `in beta'. In<BR>the Real World, systems (hardware or software) software often go<BR>through two stages of release testing: Alpha (in-house) and Beta<BR>(out-house?). Beta releases are generally made to a group of lucky<BR>(or unlucky) trusted customers.<P></I>However, there are variants on that definition, one of the most common (andfor our purpose, most troublesome) being the substitution of "featurecomplete" for "mostly working". To my knowledge, no MMO has ever reachedBeta truly "feature complete"; most have <B>launched</B> with major featuresnot yet implemented. In some cases, the lack of these features has gonebeyond being a source of complaints to becoming a running joke ("paid Beta","fun to be patched in later"). In the worst cases, expansion packs haveshipped as "empty boxes", <b>none</b> of the features listed on the boxesactually working until weeks or months later. In addition, Betas have becomeinextricably part of the marketing plans of the games: a good beta canprovide an irreplacable boost to the word of mouth for a game (and a bad oneundo millions of dollars worth of traditional marketing through badbuzz).<P>The problems arise because of the differing agendas of the parties involvedin bringing the games to and through the beta process, and their differingexpectations of what they are supposed to accomplish. The fact is, ourtraditional Alpha/Beta division does not serve the needs of these gameswell. Well before the full featureset is in place, the complexity surpassesthe point where internal QA processes are adequate to cope. You simply can'teven make a serious attempt at full-regression organized QA; the manpowerrequirements are far too high. Even by the softer, "mostly working"definition, what works at a peak load of 30 players may fail disastrously at300. More subtle problems, like database corruption, may only appear afterweeks or months of heavy abuse, or only under extreme conditions of variablenetwork latency combined with unlikely (but statistically inevitable)events, like two people logging into the game in the exact samepicosecond.<P>Beyond that, there are the marketing implications. Ideally, Beta isn't aboutmarketing, it's about making the games work. In the real world, only a foolignores the impact of "beta buzz". Beta testers telling their friends"You've <B>got</B> to try this game" is the most powerful marketing force inthe industry. A few thousand evangelists working their personal socialnetworks is better than millions of dollars of paid advertising. By the sametoken, beta testers saying "don't bother, it sucks" can kill a game, nomatter how much money is spent on marketing. In fact, it's quite possiblethat the only function of traditional marketing for MMO's is in "validating"the buzz; if you have full-page spreads in magazines it makes it easier forthose hearing positive buzz (especially those working for the magazines) togive it credence. NDA's are of only limited usefulness in containing this.In some cases they may be counterproductive (when they are widely ignored bythose that dislike the game, but respected by those who like it).<P>On the other hand, for the purposes of getting high-quality feedback thattells you what is wrong and where to look in order to fix it, Beta sucks.Comparatively few of the testers submit feedback of any kind, and those thatdo tend to submit the same reports in slightly different forms (and with wide variations in detail). The most common return from any in-game bugreporting tool is the word "bug", with nothing else. Most of the testers arethere to get a sneak peek and/or play for free; most of the remainderdoesn't know *how* to be a good tester. Also, the Beta process is acontinual contest over the design of the game, both between the company andthe tester community, and usually within the company itself; bug reportsoften become weapons in that conflict.<P>So Betas become exercises in community management, usually long before theteam is ready to make the transition from developing a game to operatingone. Meanwhile, an increasingly jaded marketplace is judging the Betaagainst the same standards they judge games at launch, or even years pasttheir launch. All games, from the venerable established title with nearly adecade of operation, to the newest and rawest creation just leaving"technology demo" status, are competing for the same "mind share" in themarketplace. This is a long-term trend that bodes ill for the industry, butis beyond the scope of this week's column.<P>What is within the scope is to try and better define the *types* of beta, toestablish that there are distinct stages with distinct needs that arecurrently being lumped into the generic label of "Beta". To the best of myability to ascertain, these are the categories (namesassigned-semi-arbitrarily):<P><UL><LI>Development Beta</li><li>Playtesting Beta</li><li>Scaling Beta</li><li>Load Beta</li></ul><B>Development Beta:</B><BR>This phase starts very early, and could also be termed a "Public Alpha".Gameplay features are under constant development, fundamental architectures are still being established, severe and critical bugs are commonplace, andcontent is nearly non-existent. Because so much is not yet in place, thegame can still undergo major changes. Because so much is not in place, thegame is not very fun, and tester dropout rates are high and average hoursplayed is low. Number of testers is in the sub-500 range, with maybe 100-150truly active in the testing (and a high proportion of those engaged in adialog with the developers). In many ways, this is the "honeymoon" period ofgame development; the community tends to be cohesive and coherent, and theactive participants highly engaged and hopeful for the game's prospects.Until all major gameplay systems are 80% in place, it is inadvisable to moveto the next stage.<P><B>Playtesting Beta:</B><BR>This phase appears slowly out of the Development Beta. Systems and featuresare mostly in place, but tuning and playability factors are woefullyinadequate. Content is sparse, generic, and mostly uninspired. The communityof active testers is only slightly larger (150-250), but considerableattrition of the original tester base has occurred, and there is somefriction between the remaining "old hands", who have personal relationshipswith the development team and a high degree of investment in the game, andthe newer testers. There is often considerable acrimony between variousfactions of the tester community, especially over fundamental game issues.The newer testers are less engaged and motivated than the "old hands", andthere is usually a faction of "sore losers", who do not like the directionsome game features have taken, but are too heavily invested to walk away. Atthis stage, the basic gameplay becomes "carved in stone" or a "dead horse",and most arguments are over details of implementation within those bounds.Some testers are "gaming the team", falsifying and fabricating reports toeither get the changes they desire, or just stir things up.<P><B>Scaling Beta:</B><BR>Here the project is entering its big push, gameplay and major systems are95% done, but endless tuning, tweaking, boundary conditions repair, andbug-fixing is underway (and in fact, will never stop). Content is beingdeveloped at a rapid rate, and the "feel" of the world is being established.The tester community grows throughout this phase, from around 350-500 up toan amount that "fully loads" one world instance. At this stage game balanceand featureset arguments reach a fever pitch, as the community becomes awarethat what is in place is very much what will be in place for launch, andfinal decisions are made on what to cut from the design. Overall feedbackvolumes are so high, and quality and reliability so low, that thedevelopment team becomes almost entirely dependant on a pool of trustedtesters (usually survivors from the earliest months) for actionablefeedback. If measures are not taken to replenish this pool, they will bealmost entirely depleted through attrition by the launch of the game. Mostof the testing community is increasingly feeling that they are shouting intoa void, an increasingly over-tasked team lacks time to interact with any ofthem at all. If some development team members have not been addedspecifically for the purpose of community management, and steps are nottaken to maintain a pool of reliable contacts, community relations may breakdown completely at this or the next stage.<P><B>Load Beta:</B><BR>The broad strokes of the world have all been laid out, and fine detail isbeing added. At least on occasion Gameplay is almost completely as it willbe for launch; although major changes may be made, it is unlikely they willactually fix the problems they are aimed at, and highly probable that theywill create other issues that will haunt the team for months or years. Thetester community is now enormous, numbering in the thousands, almost all ofthem being "tourists" checking out the game to see if they want to play it.Feedback volumes are incredible, average quality is nearly nil, and onlycareful filtering and management can maintain communications. The vastmajority, if not all, of the development team is in "bunker mode", focusingon their assigned tasks and trying very hard to ignore the increasinglyhostile and hysterical forums (by this stage, any forums open to the generaltester community have become solely the domain of "board warriors"). At thispoint, the die is cast and either the game will do well, or it won't, but noreliable indicators have been found to detect which based on the activity ordiscussions of the testers.<P>This is probably not the only way to define these phases, and I'm sure somewould take exception to my advice for dealing with them. But we have tostart this debate somewhere, and the key point is this: we are doingourselves a great deal of harm by not recognizing that the process we call"Beta" is actually several different things that have been lumped into onelabel, that must be recognized and handled distinctly.  What Beta means fornon-MMO's applies only to the final stage of these beasts.<P>
