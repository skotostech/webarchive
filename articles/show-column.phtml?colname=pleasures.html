<p><b>About this series:</b> <p>This series examines design considerations from live action role
playing games, and considers what techniques might be transferable to
online prose games from their more physical cousins. 

<p>Heather Logas has spent many happy years pouring her soul into
online, table top, and live action role playing games. She has
recently recieved her Master's Degree with a focus on game design and
theory. This has instilled in her the belief that she now has the
right to pontificate at will and make up words whimifically.

<p>Josh Powell has worked in the game industry for 5 years at video
game publisher Electronic Arts.  He has a passion for online games and
social networking sites and whimifically enjoys board games.
