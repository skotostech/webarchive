							<h2>Upteenth Verse, Same as the First</h2>

										September 9, 2003</b></i>


<p><I>This is the song that never ends<BR>
It just goes on and on, my friend<BR>
Someone started singing it not knowing what it was<BR>
And they'll go on singing it forever because <BR>
This is the song that never ends.... </i><P>

This column is going to be much shorter than usual, between
preparations for the conference, and wrapping up an Alpha cycle, I'm
stretched right to the limit (the alternative to short is skipping a
week).  Anyway, I've been putting together my presentation for the <a
href="http://www.gameconference.com/">Austin Game Conference</a>
entitled "Minimum Feature Set: What An MMO Must Have To Compete", and
it struck me that I've heard most of what I wanted to cover before.
In fact, I've heard it all many times, at presentations by Raph
Koster, Jessica Mulligan, Gordon Walton, and others.  Does the world
really <B>need</B> another explanation of how to tie your shoelaces in
designing MMO games?<P>

Possibly.  There are some amazingly straightforward things that we
just don't seem to be able to get right.  Even SWG, developed by an
experienced team, had all kinds of growing pains.  In their defense,
no game ever grew as fast as SWG, and some of their mistakes *were*
novel (Note: Oracle is <B>not</B> a no-brainer as choice of RDBMS
back-end).  But none the less, the biggest lesson of SWG is that some
of the problems associated with an MMO launch are apparently
unavoidable.  Customer service overload, registration/billing server
scaling issues, some of the things we've been insisting we have to get
right just don't seem to be within practical reach.<P>

So where does that leave us?  Maybe there are no more low-hanging
fruit, if we want to make good games that succeed; we're going to have
to start stretching ourselves.  "Don't screw up" is no longer
sufficient advice for the makers of an MMO game.  Anyway, that's going
to be the main thrust of my talk, that there is a list of things you
have to do right, <B>and</B> you need "One big idea", something
<B>hard</B> to do that separates your gameplay from that of anyone
else's.
