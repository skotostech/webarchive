                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Last time, on "Why Marrach Isn't the
           Movies."

<u>EXT. CASTLE MARRACH - DAY</u>

                        SHANNON
                 (smiling broadly)

           I want to talk about how Marrach
           isn't the movies ... about the
           differences between the two mediums ...

<u>EXT. CASTLE MARRACH - DAY</u>

                        PIMPLY LAD
           A sword! I want a sword! Where can I
           get a sword?

<u>INT. DINING HALL EAST - DAY</u>

                        SHANNON
                 (looking up from his
                 notebook)
           Movies are primarily a visual medium.

<u>INT. DINING HALL EAST - A FEW MONTHS AGO</u>

                        OMMALE
           Would such beauty exist if there was
           no one to see it?

<u>INT. THE SKOTOS OFFICE - DAY</u>

                        SHANNON
           Next ... I want to talk about those
           other two topics ... how movies are
           discontinuous and how they're contained.

<u>EXT. CASTLE MARRACH - NIGHT</u>

Castle Marrach explodes.

SCREAMS and SHOUTS arise from the crowd of Castle Dwellers, which
begins to huddle together. One BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA's voice can be
heard above the DIN.

                        BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA
           My gowns! My chemises! My beautiful
           snoods!

<u>FADE TO:</u>

<u>INT. THE SKOTOS OFFICE - NIGHT</u>

Shannon's desk is piled even higher with papers, carbon copies, and
triplicate forms than before. The paperwork looms in a vaguely ominous
manner.

Behind the desk is a whiteboard which is now covered with gibberish in
six distinct primary colors. Above them all, in black is, scrawled the
phrase "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn ... for
now!" Whatever that means.

SHANNON is slumped most unergonomically in an ergonomic office
chair. He is in his late 20s, sloppily dressed, and looking quite
tired. SUPERIMPOSE: <u>MAY 31, 2001.</u>

                        SHANNON
           The Castle is fine folks. That was
           just a hook to grab your attention.
                 (pauses)
           I can't speak for the snoods however.

Shannon sort of rolls out of his chair, then gets to his feet,
stretching as he does. Glancing at his whiteboard, he frowns.

                        SHANNON
                 (looking at the
                 whiteboard)
           I'm not sure what that means.

Shannon shrugs then erases the whiteboard and writes in big letters
"Why Marrach Isn't the Movies (Part Two)"

                        SHANNON
           I appreciate your patience folks. It's
           been a busy few weeks. But, I'm
           finally ready to continue with my
           topic of late April ... how Marrach
           isn't the Movies.
                 (pauses)
           I've got two more thing to cover and I
           want to jump straight into them: how
           movies are discontinuous and
           how movies are contained.
                 (pauses)
           And I'm afraid I've come to the
           conclusion that I'm only going to get
           to the question of discontinuities
           today ... so containment will have to
           wait

Shannon SNAPs his fingers and a movie screen descends from the
ceiling, eclipsing the white board and the words written
there. SUPERIMPOSE: <u>PART II: MOVIES ARE A DISCONTINUOUS MEDIUM.</u>

                        SHANNON
           So, discontinuous, what does that
           mean?
                 (pauses)
           Mainly it means that movies jump
           around without showing you what goes
           on between. You don't have to go on
           long car trips with movies
           characters, unless that's the point
           of the movie. You don't even have to
           walk with them from room to room.
                 (pauses)
           Movies jump about chronologically and
           geographically in order to give
           maximum impact to their stories.
                 (pauses)
           On the other hand in Castle Marrach
           you have to trudge all about the
           Castle and you have to wait for days
           or weeks for plots to reach conclusion.

Shannon points at the movie screen and numbers begin to pop up on the
screen: "9", 8", "7" ...

                        SHANNON
           To try and demonstrate this a little
           better, I've strung together a few
           scenes from the Castle. They show what
           life would be like if Marrach <u>were</u> a
           movie.

The number count on the screen continues: "2", 1". Then the screen
goes black.

<u>INT. THE LECTURE ROOM - A WHILE AGO</u>

A crowd of people are milling about a room filled with chairs. A
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN is speaking from a lectern at the front of the room,
but no one seems to be paying her much attention.

Suddenly VICTOR bursts into the room. He's unshaven and scarred, and
thus clearly must be a bad guy.

                        VICTOR
           The Queen sucks!

Members of the milling crowd glance fearfully at each other.

                        VICTOR
           And you're all Nancy Boys!

MARTINI, a muscular, dark-haired man steps forth from the crowd.

                        MARTINI
           Uh, I don't think I am.

                        VICTOR
                 (cackling gleefully)
           Then it shall be ...
                 (he pulls out his
                 sword)
           ... a duel!

A grimace, or perhaps a shadow of fear, crosses Martini's face.

<u>INT. PRACTICE ROOM - A WHILE AGO</u>

Martini is beating a practice dummy with his sword.

                        MARTINI
           Must ... duel ... better ...

<u>EXT. OUTER COURTYARD - A WHILE AGO</u>

Martini is jogging in place.

                        MARTINI
           Must ... build ... endurance ...

<u>INT. PRACTICE ROOM - A WHILE AGO</u>

Martini is beating that dummy again; it's not clear who's getting the
better of it.

                        MARTINI
           Must ... kill ... dummy ...

<u>EXT. GATE COURTYARD - A WHILE AGO</u>

Martini is doing push-ups on the cold, stone cobbles.

                        MARTINI
           Must ... ask Ermingarde ... for
           mittens ...

<u>INT. PRACTICE ROOM - A WHILE AGO</u>

The practice room is now filled with the thronging hoards of the Outer
Bailey. They are whispering, joking, and pointing, much to the
distress of SIR LAUNFAL, the uptight chamberlain, who is trying to
keep everyone in line.

                        SIR LAUNFAL
           It is clearly stated in the Queen's
           Capitulary that fidgeting during a
           sanctioned duel can be punishable by
           three days in the stockade or ...

No one's listening to him, and very soon his voice is lost amidst the
RUMBLING OF THE CROWD.

In the center of the room stand Martini and Victor. Martini has a
proper dueling blade, engraved with a quill. Victor has a huge
two-handed blade covered with rust ... or perhaps dried blood.

Victor licks his two-handed sword just to be gross.

A SNIDE WOMAN in the crowd comments to HER FRIEND.

                        SNIDE WOMAN
           He's compensating ...

Suddenly Victor lunges at Martini who just barely gets his sword up in
time. The duel has begun!

                        SIR LAUNFAL
           Ah ... Ah ... You may begin!

Swords clang! Victor has the upper hand! Then Martini! Then Victor!
Then Martini again! This is very exciting!

                        MARTINI
                 (softly)
           You shouldn't have brought my mother
           into this ...

Victor looks worried. He's losing! How could he have said anything
about Martini's mother? No one fights better than a cornered son!

Then, Victor has a sudden inspiration. He kicks Martini in the ribs!

                        MARTINI
           Agh!

Victor seizes the moment and stabs Martini through the right arm!
Martini falls to the ground!

                        VICTOR
                 (hopping up and down)
           Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?

Victor goes dancing out the door, waving his sword over his head.

                        MARTINI
                 (sobbing silently)
           I am shamed ...

<u>EXT. THE STAIRS IN THE GATE COURTYARD - A WHILE AGO</u>

Victor is dancing down the stairs, still waving his sword.

                        VICTOR
                 (shouting)
           Me! Me! Me!

<u>INT. THE PRACTICE ROOM - A WHILE AGO</u>

Martini has collapsed to the ground now, his sword fallen to the side.

                        MARTINI
                 (still sobbing)
           Shamed ...

<u>INT. THE DINING HALL - A WHILE AGO</u>

Victor now sits at the round table in the dining hall. He raises a mug
of beer above his head.

                        VICTOR
                 (loudly)
           To me.

His words ECHO LOUDLY. He lifts the mug to his lips and drinks the
beer down. The mug disappears in a puff of white smoke.

Victor looks at his hand, and then about the empty room, sadness on
his face.

<u>INT. THE PRACTICE ROOM - A WHILE AGO</u>

The crowd has thronged around Martini. They are patting him on the
back, touching him on the shoulder, or just giving him the thumbs up
sign.

                        SNIDE WOMAN
                 (running her hands
                 through Martini's hair)
           You won today just by fighting,
           Marty ...

Martini looks up at Snide Woman and smiles.

<u>FADE TO:</u>

<u>INT. THE SKOTOS OFFICE - NIGHT</u>

A bright light now shows on the movie screen until Shannon wiggles his
nose, making the light go out.

                        SHANNON
           Whoa .... sorry about that folks.
           That last line was worthy of <u>Titanic.</u>

Shannon shakes his head, then quickly gestures toward the ceiling with
his right index finger. The movie screen goes flying up into the
ceiling.

                        SHANNON
           In any case, I hope my movie helped
           to demonstrate how a discontinuous
           movie can be very different thing
           from the continuous experience of
           Castle Marrach.
                 (pauses)
           I used the discontinuities in my
           mini-movie to do a number of things.
                 (pauses)
           First, I jumped in when things got
           interesting.
                 (pauses)
           Second, I skipped over boring details
           like asking Launfal for permission to
           duel.
                 (pauses)
           Third, I increased the impact of the
           plot by placing it all at the same
           moment in time ... without breaking
           it up with lots of irrelevent stuff.

Shannon glances up at the whiteboard, almost empty now, and realizes
that it doesn't offer any help.

                        SHANNON
           In Castle Marrach, a similar plot
           took a few weeks to execute. Though
           it was a lot of fun I'd like to think
           that my tight shooting offered more
           emotional impact.
                 (pauses)
           But this doesn't help you a lot when
           you're considering plots for Castle
           Marrach because the game is by nature
           continuous. So, how can we learn from
           movies here?

Shannon strides up to the white board and erases it again.

                        SHANNON
           It won't surprise you to hear I have
           a few suggestions.

Shannon writes "Movies are discontinuous."

                        SHANNON
           And it's my belief that introducing
           some discontinuities into Castle
           Marrach can improve your plots.

Shannon writes "1. Don't be afraid to start <u>en media res.</u>

                        SHANNON
           We creative people come up with
           strange foreign words to hide the
           secrets of our craft. I'm probably
           violating my Masonic oath here when I
           tell you that en media res means "in
           the middle of things", more or less.
                 (pauses)
           The point is that you can start a
           plot without what went before
           actually happening. You just need to
           introduce the backstory via other
           methods.

Abruptly the white board is filled with images as a new movie starts
up. Shannon frowns a bit and looks up at the movie screen which is now
hidden up in the ceiling. Finally he shrugs his shoulders and
concentrates on the movie.

<u>INT. A MOVIE SET PORTRAYING THE PRACTICE ROOM - DAY</u>

The room is filled with people sparring and people watching people
sparring. VICTOR stands off to the side, heckling duelists.

                        VICTOR
           You're holding that blade like a wet
           noodle! 
                 (pauses)
           You're not guarding your right side! 
                 (pauses)
           Your momma dresses you funny!

Suddenly, a BIG MAN bursts into the room. He's big! He's muscular!
He's the spitting image of Victor except he doesn't spit. He clean
shaven and unscarred too, proving that he must be an OK-guy. He
doesn't even sneer!

                        BIG MAN
           You won't get away with this Victor!
           I know you poisoned my love,
           Beatrice, because she fell for me,
           your twin brother, Victee, rather
           than you.
                 (pauses)
           I know you stole her precious
           Sapphire of the Fallen Snow and hid
           it away somewhere in the Castle.
                 (pauses)
           I know that a servant witnessed your
           evil deed and I shall find who they
           are.
                 (pauses)
           Who shall join me?

A loud cheer goes up, and many members of the crowd throng around
VICTEE (BIG MAN).

Victor looks non-plussed, like this happens every day.

<u>THE SKOTOS OFFICE - NIGHT</u>

Though a light is still shining on the whiteboard, the writing on the
board is visible once more.

                        SHANNON
           Right into the middle of the
           action. That's the way to go, and the
           first way to make discontinuities
           your friend.

Shannon writes on the whiteboard "2. Don't be afraid to introduce
discontinuities into the middle of the story."

                        SHANNON
           This is pretty much the same idea, so
           I'm not going to try and work up a
           clever clip.
                 (pauses)
           If you're running a plot just
           remember ... if there's going to be
           anything somewhat boring you can just
           pretend it happened, and report out
           in whatever way is appropriate ...
           just like you'd report backstory.

Shannon writes "3. Don't be bound by quaint notions of time and
space."

                        SHANNON
           This last one is tricky because you
           can really blow every one's
           suspension of disbelief if you're not
           careful. But, remember, you're gaming
           in a virtual world, and thus you're
           not bound by the rules that you'd be
           bound by in physical reality.
                 (pauses)
           You really want to keep your plots as
           tight as possible ... mainly meaning
           tight in time. And you can do some
           stuff to help that out.
                 (pauses)
           You can quickly pop from location to
           location to conduct different scenes.
                 (pauses)
           You can ignore your characters' other
           concerns for a short time to
           concentrate on your core plot.
                 (pauses)
           And, you can allow those off-screen
           discontinuities to occur very
           quickly.

Shannon glances back at the whiteboard which is growing dark once
again as new images appear there.

<u>INT. A MOVIE SET PORTRAYING LAUNFAL'S OFFICE - DAY</u>

Bookcases adorn the walls of Sir Launfal's office and it's obvious
that everything is in perfect order. All of the books are organized by
color, then by ascending height.

Launfal's desk is equally neat. A pile of a dozen inboxes are each
partially filled with neat stacks of paper. The actual surface of
Launfal's desk is remarkably empty.

Sir Launfal sits behind his desk, his posture perfect. A BEAUTIFULLY
DRESSED SERA stands opposite Sir Launfal. She is not wearing a
snood. A COURIER leans against the doorway to the office.

                        SIR LAUNFAL
           These allegations you bring against
           Mark are most serious. I will
           investigate them.

Sir Launfal motions to the Courier who goes running out of the room.

                        SIR LAUNFAL
           Is there anything else I may do for
           you, Sera?

                        BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA
           Yes, I was wondering if I might
           get ...

                        SIR LAUNFAL
           No swords! I have no swords! You may
           not get a sword!

                        BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA
                 (gasping)
           A snood! I just wanted a snood!

She begins to cry.

Sir Launfal looks around to see if there's anyone to help. There
isn't. He brightens up when ...

The Courier runs back into the room. 

The Courier whispers something in Launfal's ear. He brightens up even
more.

                        SIR LAUNFAL
           Good news, Sera.

Her cries come to a gasping halt. She looks up at Sir Launfal.

                        SIR LAUNFAL
           It appears that you are quite right,
           and that Mark is not romancing just
           one, but several other women
           currently.

The Beautifully Dressed Sera begins sobbing uncontrollably again.

The Courier shrugs his shoulders, then runs out the door.

Sir Launfal looks uncomfortable for a moment, then tries to look busy
by starting to rearrange his books.

<u>THE SKOTOS OFFICE - DAY</u>

Shannon SNAPS his fingers one more time to turn off the light
projecting onto the whiteboard.

                        SHANNON
           There you go. A slightly unrealistic
           crunching of time lends impact to the
           scene without necessarily destroying
           suspension of disbelief.
                 (pauses)
           Just use it with care.

Shannon paces back and forth for a few seconds, looking ominously at
the piles of paper on his desk.

                        SHANNON
           And that's it for me this week
           folks. Sometime soon I'll finish this
           off by talking about how movies are
           self-contained. It's kind of a
           mirror-image to this episode because
           it also talks about how text games
           can be improved by making them less
           like real life.
                 (pauses)
           And just to tantalize you, let me
           offer the following preview: one of
           our actors from this week tries to
           jump off the parapet.

Shannon waggles his eyebrows.

                        SHANNON
           See you then!

<u>EXT. A SNOWY PARAPET - NIGHT</u>

A shadowy figure stands on the parapet, leaning out into the
wind. SUPERIMPOSE: <u>WILL IT BE ...</u>

The figure's face is revealed as Martini's. SUPERIMPOSE: <u>MARTINI?</u>

                        MARTINI
                 (sobbing)
           My shame is as deep as this ravine.

Martini FADES OUT to be replaced by a much more shapely figure who is
revealed to be the Beautifully Dressed Sera. She too is leaning
dangerously into the wind. SUPERIMPOSE: <u>THE BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA?</u>

                        BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED SERA
                 (sobbing)
           I can not go on without my snoods!

The Beautifully Dressed Sera FADES OUT to be replaced by a large,
unwieldly figure. He too is leaning out into the wind. It's Victor!
SUPERIMPOSE: <u>OR VICTOR?</u>

                        VICTOR
                 (belching)
           I think I dropped my beer!

Victor begins to flail his arms and fall forward, then the screen
FADES TO BLACK.
