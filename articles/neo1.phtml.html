<p> As we stop ringing in the new year, I'd like toring in a new  column for all you MUD coders out there.  Thiscolumn will explore  the state of MUD, MUSH and MOO coding in the freeand open source  community.  We'll also make appropriate digressionsto mention  groups like Skotos and Achaea who drive the state ofthe art forward  but don't make their code public.  Whether you'rewriting your own  codebase, making little edits of somebody else's, orjust writing  new functions to keep your builders happy,NeoArchaeology is meant  for you. </p><p> To do anything well, you should understand whatother people have  done before you.  There's a name for being familiarwith what other  people have done before in your art or science:literacy.  NeoArchaeology isn't about English Literacy -- it'sabout MUD  Codebase Literacy.  I'm going to start the columnwith a survey of  the state of literacy in the MUD coding community. Later, the  column will delve into ways to make yourself moreMUD-literate, and  examine some features of building new text games.</p><h3> Literacy and Literature </h3><p> The programming circles that have the strongestopen source  projects tend to have a lot of cooperation.  Thinkof the  cryptography community, the Linux kernel community,the various  groups doing CrystalSpace development.  They allhave a strong  understanding of what competing efforts areunderway.  Each group  has experts that cooperate with each other, usuallyin small groups,  and usually in ways visible to the public.  Thegroups have a good  grasp of what's going on in their own community, andin others like  it.  What groups can you think of in the open sourceMUD community  that have this same grasp on what's going on, andhave competent  people cooperating to spread understanding of theirsubject matter?  </p><p> I can think of only one.  J.C. Lawrence's <a  href="https://www.kanga.nu/lists/listinfo/mud-dev/">MUD-Dev mailing  list </a> is reasonably aware of what goes on in theMUD community.  They represent a variety of camps within the MUDcommunity,  including Diku-based, LPMUD and a wide variety ofindependent  efforts.  They have 'elders' like J.C. Lawrence,Raph Koster and  Matt Mihaly, who have written interesting MUDs andmay even do MUD  coding as their profession.  They routinely discussnew and  interesting MUD development ideas, and they have anarchive of these  discussions reaching back for years.  Do yourself afavor and browse  the list archives for a bit, just to get a feel forit. </p><p> Unfortunately the list is hard to search throughand there isn't  any better-organized version of its contents.  Theeasiest way to  find out whether they've critiqued something like itis to ask the  list again.  That's inconvenient, wasteful, andprovides no good  survey of the many, many MUD ideas that have crossedthe list.  You  can see one attempt at organization by the MUD-Devmembers by  looking at <ahref="http://agora.cubik.org">Agora</a>.  Agora is a  lovely idea.  But it shows vividly that only a tinyfraction of  MUD-Dev's archive has been organized.  And there'sno better version  available. </p><p> There are good sites out there with forums andarticles.  <a  href="http://mudconnect.com"> The MUD Connector</a>, <a  href="http://www.kyndig.com"> Kyndig </a>, <a  href="http://mudplanet.org"> MUD Planet </a> and <a  href="http://www.topmudsites.com"> TopMUDSites </a>are just some of  the best, and there are many more.  Yet they sufferfrom the same  problems as MUD-Dev, usually more severely.  Theirforums don't  always archive old messages, and the sites provideno good way to  search for old topics, or browse organized lists oftopics (no,  viewing the latest stuff by thread doesn't count). The best posts  aren't collected and linked on an index page. Instead, you have to  look through many, many posts to find them, usuallybased on when  they were posted.  The articles, if they exist, arefew in number,  mixed in quality and come out irregularly. </p><p> There are a few good, unified resources available. The  MUDConnector is probably the best example.  It'swithout peer as a  listing of MUDs.  Other sites like MUD Planet oftenget their own  lists directly from the MUDConnector.  There is<i>no</i> equivalent  to this service for listings of MUD codebases, orfor almost any  form of MUD documentation or MUD code.  Searchingfor such things is  a scavenger hunt through many scattered sites, oftendefunct. </p><p> There <i>are</i> indexes and listings ofcodebases, of course.  There are various 'snippets' sites and theoccasional actual site of  documentation.  But web pages go out of date and FTPsites go down  over the years.  Outdated links are the rule, notthe exception,  among MUD resource web sites.  The MUD-Dev list'ssite fights this  problem by mirroring all good resources, but fewsimilar sites do  the same.  And while you can find a few interestinglinks on many  different sites, there isn't any single, centralsite with a  comprehensive listing. </p><p> MUDs have existed for about thirty years.  Yet injust three years  Skotos has managed to accumulate the best archive ofMUD and  game-design articles in existence.  And they used<i>no</i> old  material.  Skotos' writers are very good, but arethey as good as  everyone else in the industry put together?  Canthey best everyone  else <i>combined</i> in far less than half the time? What does that  tell us about how well we use and archive our olddesign notes, our  old articles?  Some of the common codebases are overten years old,  so where are our classic articles, our best works ofdesign  literature?  Where is an older equivalent to theSkotos articles?  </p><h3> Inertia and Stasis </h3><p> New ideas and major new features don't make itinto major,  well-known codebases very often.  When I say that, Imean that new  AI systems, new output systems, new systems ofphysics and weather  are all rarely added to an existing codebase.  Acodebase will add  features to catch up with other similar codebases,but rarely will  something genuinely new be added.  Note that I'm notcounting the  various individual MUD efforts adding code thatnever gets released  -- only the large shared repositories like CircleMUDor Smaug or  LDMUD or TinyMUSH. </p><p> One reason is that writing a MUD codebase is alarge task, and  nearly everyone with a good idea begins it nearlyfrom scratch  rather than using an existing base.  That's true inmany fields of  programming, but it seems to be especially universalamong MUD  programmers.  In other fields the conventionalwisdom is to start  from scratch rarely, and normally only when theexisting code is  unusable.  Yet MUD writers are routinely advised towrite an entire  new MUD, from nothing.  Why?  I'll discuss that inmore detail in  future columns.  A hint: licensing of codebases, andscarcity of  experienced, literate programmers both contribute.</p><h3> Literate Coders </h3><p>  You don't often see young MUD coders learning aboutwhat's out there  before they sit down to write their own codebase.  Ifirst wrote  that line several weeks ago.  For the past few days,the DGD mailing  list has been swamped with email from a fellow whohas decided that  the existing codebases for DGD are too complicatedand intricate to  bother understanding, so he'll write his own thatworks better.  He  seems to be a quite decent coder, yet he uses thatreasoning.  Am I  the only one who sees that as a fundamentalcontradiction? </p><p> New programmers set out to solve problems, towrite a grand new  codebase, and that's wonderful.  But why do theyread through only a  little documentation, and only two or three existingcodebases at  <i>most</i>? </p><p> I believe that the very biggest reason is a lackof existing  literate coders.  The various MUD camps(MUCK/MUSH/MOO,  Diku/Merc/Rom, LP*) don't mingle much, and fewpeople know a  reasonable amount about more than one of them.  It'shard to become  literate in existing MUDs if you have no rolemodels, no overviews  and surveys, no people who can answer broadquestions like &quot;has  anybody ever tried this before on a largescale?&quot;.  It's hard  to become a literate coder in a vacuum, havingnobody to compare  notes with.  The lack of decent programmingdocumentation for any  existing MUD doesn't help.  Reading source codetakes a lot of time  and effort, and few new coders understand just howimportant it is.  So few of them bother to do it. </p><p> At this point, it's obligatory to mention brashyoung programmers,  considering themselves cowboys, who are going torevolutionize the  world of MUDs all by themselves, and how they startover not because  the existing code is bad, and not because they knownothing about  it, but because that's their way. </p><p> Balderdash.  I've gone to school with those brashyoung  programmers, worked jobs next to them, trained themin programming,  worked with them on open source projects in 3Dgraphics and 3D  modeling...  MUD programmers aren't all thatdifferent a breed.  They're just in a deceptively easy-lookingdiscipline and have  nobody really impressive to compete against.  Theyare neither good  software engineers (who is, when they start?) norawed.  They  believe they can do everything that the existingcodebases can do,  given enough time.  And sadly, they're mostly right. At least, if  they had a decade going spare. </p><h3> Becoming Literate </h3><p>  In the mean time, it's important to do what<i>you</i> can do to  prepare yourself.  Whether you're writing anentirely new kind of  MUD or just adding a few features to an existingone, it's good to  know what people have done already.  It's importantto know what  resources are out there (imperfect though they maybe), and use the  good parts.  It's <i>very</i> important to know whohas written a  tool you could use for your work.</p><p>  I'm going to try to alternate overview articles likethis one with  cheerier pieces about what a few MUDs are doing veryright, and  discussions of various features.  So I'll talk aboutlicensing in  MUD codebases, but not for the next article.  FirstI'll see you in  two weeks when I talk about building MUDs, andestimating the amount  of work you'll need for the next Great American MUD.</p>
