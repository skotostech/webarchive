            <h2>Interview with David Bowman of Tulga Games </h2>
            <p><i><b>by Shannon Appelcline<br>
            2006-06-22</b></i><br><br>

<p><i>David Bowman is a veteran of the gaming industry who is nowleading Tulga Games and their online MMORPG, </i>Horizons: Empire ofIstaria<i>. This interview with him was conducted by Shannon Appelclineof Skotos.</i>.<hr><p><b>Shannon Appelcline:</b> Tell me a bit about your background in the onlinegaming industry.<p><b>David Bowman:</b> I started with Bungie as a designer for Myth II.  WhenMicrosoft started conversations with Bungie about acquisition I went toTurbine. <i>Asheron's Call</i> had just launched and they were hiringdesigners. MMOs are the next great evolution in entertainment  and Iknew where I wanted to be working. I became the Vice President ofProduction at Turbine and led the AC live team until July of 2001. Artifact Entertainment hired me then and I've been with Horizons: Empireof Istaria through the launch and Tulga Games' acquisition of theproject and team.<P>I'm now the CEO and Creative Director for Tulga Games. Because wehave a small team focused on Horizons, I wear multiple hats in additionto those titles. I provide the Live team with world building, questcreation and data entry whenever it's needed. It can make for longweeks, but for a small company it's essential  that the leader of thecompany understand the product, service and audience.<p><b>SA:</b> You say that MMOs are the next great evolution inentertainment. What makes them so?<img src="../artwork/gv4-1.jpg" width=200 height=345 align="right" border=1><p><b>DB:</b> If I were to list what I consider to be the great forms ofentertainment of history I'd do it like this: dance, music,story-telling, painting, games, theater, books, radio, movies,television, and electronic gaming.<p>Electronic gaming has been for most of its brief life an isolatingform of entertainment, similar to books. You could play <i>Asteroids</i>with others and you can read a book with your children, but theygenerally are experienced as individuals. Along comes the Internet andsuddenly it's possible to really start playing games with other people. Add to this console gaming and we start to see electronic gaming becomea social experience.<p>We, as an industry, have now developed massively multi-player onlinetechnology that lets thousands play in a shared persistent space withothers from anywhere on the planet. This is a significant social change.<p>To date we've used this power to generally create persistentcharacter changes that express power gain. This appeals very well to themale dominance urges in many people in society. What's going to happenas we expand into other expressions and other forms of interaction inpersistent spaces that allow people to shape that space? Andy Tepper's<i>A Tale in the Desert</i> series, Linden Lab's <i>Second Life</i>, andour <i>Horizons</i> allow people to begin expressing their ideas aboutcontent and permanent changes to the shared persistent spaces. As thetechnologies become more powerful, and the teams that create the toolsthat allow the shaping and expression to occur in persistent space learnmore about what is possible and what is desired, we will see thisentertainment blossom.<p>Much in the same way that movies have blossomed as cameras, soundequipment, and sets became widely available to creative talent. As thetechnology standardizes and the costs of technology drop then contentbecomes the defining commodity.<p><b>SA:</b> Content as a defining commodity in electronicentertainment is an interesting point, and one that I don't think hasbeen fully explored. Linden Labs has pretty explicitly monetized contentby allowing players to purchase content from other players using Lindydollars. Meanwhile, a lot of other companies, including the moretraditional achiever-based MMORPGs seem to be always treading watertrying to stay a couple of steps ahead of the players. By what methodsis <i>Horizons</i> allowing for user-created content that we're notseeing elsewhere?<p><b>DB:</b> In most of the MMOs that exist you can make changes to yourcharacters (I can't think of an exception, but there might be). This isthe first level of persistent information that is shaped by playerbehaviours. Character creation and equipment/clothing that you obtainfor your character allows you to express your will in shaping what otherplayers see when they view your character. This is user-shaped content,but it is only evident when your character is actively logged into theworld. That has been successfully proven to be of sufficient value tocharge a subscription. <i>Horizons</i> has a huge variety of appearancechoices right out of the gate with 11 distinctively different races,each with a large number of modifications. I am constantly pleased andsurprised by the beautiful Dragons varieties and other player-races thatplayers create.<p>The second level of persistent information shaped by players is thephysical world. The expression 'player housing' is used by  companies toindicate that players can purchase a building and within that buildingsometimes make changes that are perceived by other players even when theowner is not logged in. This begins to have a real impact because unlikenon-persistent games and some MMOs, this player choice is visible toothers for as long as the service is available. <p><i>Horizons</i> takesthis even further, allowing you to buy a plot of land in the seamlessworld (no zones) and then choose many different types of buildings,their  exact locations and orientations, and then build them. Youliterally can run into entirely player-built communities. And each ofour shards deviates from the others, so that the shards expressthemselves differently in the communities. Dragons can create fantasticlairs running deep below the ground, each shaped by their owner andbeing uniquely expressed. Our upcoming expansion <i>Horizons: TheSettlements</i> will take this even further allowing players to craftand trade furniture and other decorations for these buildings.<p><center><img src="../artwork/gv4-2.jpg" width=500 height=378 align="center" border=1></center><p>The third level of persistent information is the lore/story of theworld. In <i>Horizons</i> we've created a quest editor that allows usersto submit complete quests directly into our submissions database. Aftera designer has reviewed the quest, it can be approved with a few mouseclicks and integrated into our game databases. The first series of theseuser-created quests went live this week. We've also used this tool tohelp Peter S. Beagle, author of <i>The Last Unicorn</i>, to help createhis own quest-line within <i>Horizons</i>.<p><center><img src="../artwork/gv4-3.jpg" width=500 height=445 align="center" border=1></center><p>I'm extremely happy that several other companies are also headed inthis direction and wish them success. It is the natural evolution of ourtechnology to make it simpler to use and get it into the hands of asmany creative people as possible.<p><b>SA:</b> The player-generated quest-lines sound great: a way forplayers to make a permanent mark upon the game, even if it's done in anout-of-character way ... and something I haven't really heard of before.<p>There's also one more type of persistence which I've always lookedfor in games, which is <i>change</i> in a persistent world. Can playersforever destroy monsters, overthrow kingdoms, or make changes in thegameworld that are notable and large? It sounds like your communitiesare part of that, but anything further has typically been hard toimplement because it's so open-ended.<p><i>Ultima Online</i> tried to simulate monster ecologies as oneexample of this, and it failed pretty badly. Other games have sometimesallowed big changes in their gameworld based upon the average results ofquests (or even the expected results of quests), but it's always beenone-time, and heavily administrative controlled.<p>Any thoughts on expanding this envelope further?<p><b>DB:</b> This type of change is present in <i>Horizons</i> as partof our Live  Events series. When we launched <i>Horizons</i> there wereonly 9 species that players could play. Satyrs were an ensorcelled raceunder the control of the evil Withered Aegis and Dryads were only ahistorical reference with the occasional undead Dryad indicating theywere more than myth. <p>Through player actions that included the construction of tunnelsthrough the world, bridges across the sea and the destruction ofguardian monsters and mind-controlling structures, the Satyrs became afreed race that was then playable and the Dryads returned to Istaria andbecame playable as well. This changed the world and was entirely in theplayer's control.<p>Each shard accomplished these feats independently of the othershards, and therefore each shard was extremely different for theduration of the event. We've had many other projects that involveconstruction that change the world in less extreme ways as well. Butthis type of experience is labor-intensive on the side of the developersand therefore cannot be present at all times. We have some very specificideas about how this could become more of the staple of the world,rather than the spice, but we might have to wait for our next-generationworld. We have one internally designed world concept that entirelyrevolves around players deciding the final shape and feel of theirworld. This will happen, it's a matter of time and of course money.<p><b>SA:</b> Thanks for all the thoughts on persistence.<p>I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments, about MMOs as asignificant social change. There's no doubt that it's a very differenttype of entertainment from what we've seen before. However, one of myconcerns has always been that it's, as you said, a very isolating senseof entertainment. To some extent MMOs are replacing tabletop roleplayinggame (while likewise some online strategy games are replacing theirtabletop brethren). Thus where people used to meet face-to-face around atable, eating pizza and drinking beer with their friends, they're nowsitting in front of a computer screen instead. It's actually a generalpattern of physical isolation that stems from the Internet. We go togoogle instead of libraries, to email instead of the phone, to a chatroom instead of lunch at a cafe.<p>Any thoughts on the deficits--or benefits--of this new mode of socialcontact? Does <i>Horizons</i> address it in any specific ways?<p><b>DB:</b> I grew up in a very rural portion of northern Michigan. Mysmall group of friends and I would get together for <i>D&D</i> and playwhenever we could. It was great to have that time together, so Iunderstand what you are saying, but, it would have been even better tohave had a greater pool of potential friends to meet. My ideal wouldhave been more of the Asian-style gamerooms where me and my friendscould have gotten together and played, but also connected with the restof the world at the same time.<p>I now play <i>Horizons</i> with people from around the world. I playwith  Australians, Canadians, a Malaysian, and folks from around theU.S. on a regular basis. There have been marriages because people havemet in <i>Horizons</i>, so I would say that the experience is powerfulenough to build real relationships on. True, there is no face-to-facetime like there was around the table, but in some ways that is good. People can be judged by how they behave, not how they appear.Asimov had some great sci-fi that was centered on the increasingisolation of people from physical contact due to technology. Hisforecast is indeed coming true in the ways that you mentioned, but Ithink it will balance over time. The telephone did not replace thewritten letter, just made it more specialized. Radio has not been killedby television, just changed. Personal physical human interaction isstill going to be there, but it will definitely be changed/influenced bythe new technologies, including persistent spaces.I'm aware of the impact that the ways we entertain ourselves has on ouroverall behaviour. One of the goals of <i>Horizons</i> was to make aworld where construction was as important as destruction. I wanted aworld that rewarded creation not just demolition. Having a balance wasimportant, because I believe that many of the other products areimbalanced toward death. Don't misunderstand, I like a good explosion orkilling-blow animation, but I also like a well thought out dragon lairbuilt by my actions and decisions.<p><b>SA:</b> I can see some of the positives you mention withtechnology both bridging and isolating. One of our tabletop gaming groupmoved to New Zealand and still plays with some of the group in<i>Dungeons & Dragons Online</i>, and I've definitely met people fromall over the United States and all over the world that I wouldn't havemet without the Internet.<p>So we've just touched upon Horizons thus far, mostly discussing theplayer creativity & creation that it allows. Overall, the fantasy MMOgenre is pretty full, with big names like <i>EverQuest</i> and <i>Worldsof  Warcraft</i> taking up a lot of the mindspace. Besides creativityand the ability to play dragons, what else really distinguishes<i>Horizons</i> from the pack?<p><b>DB:</b> There are a lot of books in the world, with big names likethe Bible and the Koran taking up a lot of attention, but I still thinkthat there is a lot more room for other books. Shifting to a subset ofbooks: there a lot of fantasy books in the world, with big names like<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i> taking up people'stime and money, but I'm very glad that hasn't stopped other authors fromtelling their stories. I would say that the <i>Lineage</i> franchise and<i>World of Warcraft</i> are the two big kids on the block at themoment, but that doesn't mean that there won't be other huge hits orother worlds  that appeal to those of us who feel turned off by<i>Lineage</i> and <i>WoW</i>.<p>One of my life's ambitions is to get our technology to the placewhere the creative geniuses can begin working in our medium. Imagine ifTolkien had to invent writing and the typewriter before he could begin. We'll find our Tokiens and Spielbergs when the technology becomes widelyavailable and stable.<p>To your main point: <i>Horizons</i> does have playable Dragons thatcan fly through the sky, breath fire, and create fantastic lairs beneaththe ground. It also has the best crafting system of any MMO with playersliterally being able to create the weapons, armor, clothes, and everyother piece of equipment in the game. The ability to buy land and placeas many different structures as you can fit on your land, in anylocation you choose is another powerful feature of <i>Horizons</i>. Ourcharacter advancement system is unique and I believe a great variationfrom other games. You can play as many different roles as you wish  in<i>Horizons</i> with the same character. If you want to know how to casta spell, study in the Mage school. If you want to swing a sword, studyas a Warrior. There are dozens of schools to mix and match as youchoose, not as some designer pre-ordained you would be. Our world islarge, beautiful and seamless. You don't run along and hit a barrier,waiting for the next zone to load. We have 11 very different lookingspecies/races from which to choose, and because of that you finddramatic differentiation among the player appearances. <i>Horizons</i>can be played in short play-sessions. You don't have to give up hours ofyour real life to even begin to play. You can play it for 30 minutes orall weekend long. But the biggest difference between <i>Horizons</i> andany other game is that <i>Horizons</i> has attracted the nicest, mostmature, cooperative people of any online game. <i>Horizons</i>' community feels more like a big, extended family with both the bickeringand the underlying concern for each other's welfare that you don't findin today's anonymous, aggressive, antagonistic players of PvP centeredgames. I'm a PvP player myself and enjoy the thrill of thekill-or-be-killed games but they don't generally tend toward civility. If you are looking for a different flavor, come try <i>Horizons</i>.<p><b>SA:</b> When discussing your character advancement system, youmention what would be called in the tabletop roleplaying world a"skill-based" system, rather than a "class-based" system. Did you drawany inspirations from tabletop roleplaying?<p><b>DB:</b> We had a goal for Horizons that you wouldn't be asked tomake important, irrevocable decisions before you could evaluate theconsequence of making that decision. The class systems in tabletop andelectronic gaming ask you to do exactly that. The skill systems don't,but we also didn't want player actions to become repetitive actions forthe sake of skill improvement.<p>We ended up coining a new term for <i>Horizons</i>, a school-basedsystem. There are two parts that are involved in character advancement: What  you do to advance, and what advances. In a class-based system,what you do to advance is not as important as the fact that as youadvance you are limited by the pre-defined class in what new actions youcan take or the results of the actions you can take change. In askill-based system what you do to advance your character's abilities isto use your skills, and the consequence of using your skills is to berewarded by increasing skill values. This can sometimes lead to newabilities that have a prerequiste skill value. In <i>Horizons</i> youjoin a school, and while in that school, the actions that you take(quests, hunting, gathering, crafting, constructions, combat) result inincreasing experience within that current school, which can also resultin an increase in skills associated to that school. New abilities aregained within the school that you are currently in, but the skills areuseful across all schools.<p>If you then decide that you want to stop training in a school andjoin a different school, then you can. And while in the new schooldifferent skills are improving, but the skills that you gainedpreviously are still benefitted by your previous training. The endresult is that you can mix-and-match schools to gain both improvedskills and new abilities. So it isn't a pure class or skill-basedsystem, but rather a hybrid of both which we've called schools.<p>We did look at both existing MMOs and tabletop roleplaying games. Some of the best game mechanics have been tested over a long period oftime in tabletop gaming. I would recommend that anyone wishing to be adesigner play as wide a variety of games as possible. If you only playone type of game you end up having a very narrow view of game mechanics. <p><b>SA:</b> Were there any notable lessons that you learned fromtabletop play?<p><b>DB:</b> Getting away from specific game mechanics and more to thegeneral experience the greatest lesson was that people like to gettogether in small groups and have an activity that engages their mindswhile providing a context for them to socially interact. In<i>Horizons</i> we wanted it to be easy for you and your friends to playtogether. And for the game sessions to be as long or brief as youwished. From anywhere in the huge world of <i>Horizons</i> it ispossible to recall quickly to a settled location and meet with otherplayers. It can take a significant chunk of time to reach somelocations, but getting together is quick and easy.<p>There are also few if any game mechanics that require you to stayconnected for long, uninterrupted sessions. Many of our players havesignificant demands on their time outside of games. They don't want tobe forced to stay connected to a game in order to not lose the progressthat they have earned. When you and your friends are playing around atable and the baby cries, you just stop the game, get up and deal withlife. Many online games make that difficult, but <i>Horizons</i>doesn't.<p><b>SA:</b> Which brings us back to those topics of socialization andreal life again. It's nice that <i>Horizons</i> helps to make thistransition easier.<p>I wanted to finish up by asking you a bit about your experience as agame designer. Is it what you expected, or are there aspects ofdesigning games that surprised you?<p><b>DB:</b> When I think back to working on <i>Myth II</i> I realizethat I really didn't understand the complexity of the industry, I justwanted to make games.<p>I thought that was enough, but to be a good employee, a good part ofa team, you need to understand the broader context of what you aredoing.It isn't about the designer proving he or she is clever. It isn't justabout making a game that you want to play. We are trying to entertainour audience, and that is hundreds of thousands of people. If you arelucky, it can be millions. You need to be inspired by the game you aremaking, but it is not just for you.<p>There are costs to every decision that a designer makes. Those costscan sink a project before it launches or make it launch too early. Iused to think that if it was cool that was all that mattered. One of myfirst employers, Jason Jones of Bungie is still one of the mostunderrated great developers in our industry and I'd just like to say,"Jason, I wish I understood then what I understand now." <p><b>SA:</b> Understanding the larger context and being inspired areboth memes I've pushed too for game designers.I appreciate all the insights and thoughts both into Horizons and gamedesign in general. Anything else you're interested in saying before wefinish up?<p><b>DB:</b> Thank you for your time with the interview, it's been fun.<i>Horizons</i> is here and better today than yesterday. It keepsgetting better because of the dedicated team that works incredibly hardto improve it. We believe in the long future of <i>Horizons</i> and lookforward to meeting many new people in-game.<p><b>SA:</b> Thank you!
