            <h2>Scammer Makers </h2>
            <p><i><b>by Sam Liu<br>

<p>Many believe that online games are funand it can be very true. However, there arecertain precautions that one should takebefore signing up for an online game.<p>As a matter of practice for myself, I havea stupid password (namely "hahaha") that I usein conjunction with a stupid username the first time I sign up for a game. I take a look around,and judge for myself whether or whether not agame is safe.<p>A motive of my own game in the beginning, and I'lladmit this, was to be able to see my friends' passwords. I was a 7th grader who had no idea whata "phish" was and who played many online games withfriends. In hope of stealing credits or items in thepopular games of that time (<i>Gunbound</i> or <i>Utopia</i>) Iset off to create a game.<p>A year after developing my game, I largely stoppedplay other internet games. I also put in md5 and later sh1 encryption for passwords in my game for fear of hackers. So now (and let me reassure you) my game is perfectly safe and you can be sure I will guard your privacy.<p>The point is: people have bad motives for creating gamesvery often. The best games to play are by people who wantmoney via <i>advertising</i>. Because they are getting money throughads and nothing else, they tend to protect your privacyand never ask for personal info. The game is being outrighthonest and benevolent: nothing wrong about earning some well deservedcash for entertaining people. And the best part is that the onlypeople who pay are Google adsensers or other advertisers.<p>But the biggest evil motives include<p>a) Identity theft: If they can get your credit card, SSN, or any personal info, they will use it. Not a good motive, and definately <i>not legal</i>! Beware! The percentage of makers who have this motive is smallbut it is present. I know someone who had this happen.Not fun.<p>b) Money Making Via Donations: Please, don't donatefreely unless you know where your money is going. Manypeople don't need money to support their servers; freehosting is an easy thing to get. If they do need moneyfor servers they probably only need at max like $500 a year not a stupid monthly thing. Nuh uh, no way. So yesthey want to gain popularity and earn cash. Stupid motive.<p>c) Password Harvesting (a.k.a "Phishing"): This problemruns rampant in small games. You should probably look fora complex, well-designed game before playing; not necessarily"big" but more complex than 5 functions! Because, early gameshave no password encryption. Dangerous for your privacy.<p>So yes my point is: be careful and know your stuff! <p>Hint: Little games where the administrator is friendly areusually safe. But to be on the safe side I usually have along, hard password for my personal stuff and a stupid passwordfor things like games.<p>Go and play safe =)<p>-Kaje
