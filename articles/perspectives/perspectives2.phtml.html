<p>Especially in small bug-ridden games, players like totake advantages of many exploits. The most commonof these exploits are easily blocked on the administrator’spart, but often overlooked. A game is never fun whenanother player cheats and sometimes its all about knowingthe crowd.<p>There are 3 main kinds of cheats:<ol><li>Multiaccounting<li>Bug/Hack exploitations<li>Scripting</ol><b>Multiaccount.</b> The most common problem with many games, multiaccounting is defined as“Signing up for more than 1 account in order to gainan unfair advantage”. This can be done in many ways.Some ways include gifting newbiepacks, gangbanging,and parallel banking. These common exploits driveadministrators on end and cause many games to havevarious problems.<p>Stopping multiaccounting can be very hard.In some cases, it is virtually impossible. However,some ways suggested include:<p>1) Email Verification – On registration, force playersto use email verification. Do not allow duplicate emailaddresses.<p>2) Gift/Aid/Trade Banning – Remove Gifting, aiding, andtrading. It makes the threat less potent. However thisoption is open to few as most games use trading as abasis of gameplay.<p>3) IP Singularity – Only allow signups any given IP once.This is not effective as dialupers with dynamic IP’s canjust shut down their internet and restart it. Others mayreset their DNS. Still others will use proxies and get awaywith it. This is only effective at limiting the amount ofaccounts created. In the end it can even becomean inconvienience.<p>4) Trade Balance – An interesting idea, trade balance is whereplayers accumulate “debt” according to how much aid/tradethey do. After a large amount of trade balance is accumulated,trading and aid shipments can be “taxed” (lose a certain % of it.)Eventually, they will lose 100% of the shipment. In order to reversetrade balance, a player must send shipments to other players.<p>5)Gift/Aid/Trade Limits – If your game has a number of players,allow aiding and trading with certain players only. This ideaonly works for some games; it is not that effectivethough it is a possibility.<p><b>Bug/Hack Exploitations.</b> Bug/Hack Exploitations are also common. For example, if my game has no limiting on negative numbers, thenI can buy a negative amount of units and actually get money andstuff back. Though I lose units, I can get resources, and once enoughresources accumulate, I can buy my units back. It is a very simplebug. <p>Bugs and hacks make up a relatively small percentage of cheats.However, bugs cannot really be prevented. They can be caught during testingbut the key here is that they just must be fixed fast andplayers who suffer from bugs must be compensated.<p>Topic over.<p><b>Scripting.</b> Finally there is one more kind of cheating that is very common on the web.Scripting is defined as “The use of scripts or programs to autoclick orbypass certain things creating an unfair advantage for the user”.Examples of scripts are kiddie scripts: scripts wherein playersautomatically create thousands of accounts, hoping that one of theaccounts is landed in a certain place they want in the game or isstarted in a specific situation. <p>Scripts are hard to prevent as well. The bestcure for a script is a well-written game. Well-written games makesure that every time a script is written, executions are put in if statementsto protect them from being executed at will. Also, variables are refreshedeach time.<p>You’re probably about to yell at me saying “Thanks a lot. <i>A well-written game? How in bloody heck am I supposed to do that?</i>” WellThere is a white-hat hacker world out there; people who will test foryou and help you debug. *Shrug* What can I say?<p>In conclusion, cheating is mostly preventable aside from theunpredictable bugs and server burps. However the best cureis a well-written game that can be easily fixed as exploits arediscovered. Now kids, don’t go using this as an idea columnon how to cheat!
