<I>"Today we have elves, stormtroopers and now superheroes," Koster said."We need to break out of the geek ghetto. No offense ... I am one." </I><BR><B>Raph Koster, <I>Wired</I></B><P><I>Do what'nsoever you want to do with me, Brer Fox, but please, please,please! Don't throw me in that briar patch</I><BR><B>Brer Rabbit</B><P>9 months ago, in <a href="engines9.phtml.html">Ageof Discouragement</A> I put out a vision of the future based on BruceWoodcock's <a href="http://pw1.netcom.com/~sirbruce/Subscriptions.html">MMOGSubscriptions</A> tracking that indicated 3 to 7 years of strong growth.There's a new version of that chart, and based on it I've decided I wasentirely too pessimistic: As near as I can tell, the subscription gamemarket has grown at least 65% in the last year, from 1.5M subs to 2.5M (3Mand 100% growth if you count XBox Live, which I don't).  This is not thegrowth of an industry facing imminent hardship, I would now say that weshould expect to see strong market growth for a minimum of another 7 years,with 10 years and a total market size of 30M subscribers being the mostlikely case (and I am starting to suspect that even this is pessimistic andconservative).  Break out the sunglasses, the future is painfully brighttoday.<p>This idea that our industry cannot grow unless we stop making Sci-Fi andFantasy based worlds and start making something more socially acceptable andmainstream goes way back, but I've never agreed with it.  It breaks down ontwo different grounds:<P>1) Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Terminator, Mad Max, Star Trek, Hercules,Xena, Buffy, Charmed....Harry Potter.  Geeks stopped living in the ghettowhen Bill Gates became the richest man in the world.  Today the number oneTV show is the irrepresibly geeky CSI, the number one selling book seriesstars the nerd poster child Harry Potter (and as a children's series, it isdefining the aesthetic of an entire generation), typical children aregrowing up playing collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering.Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and other undeniably "geeky" pursuits like building theirown battle tops (Beyblade) and robots (Lego Mindstorm and Bionicles).  Thisisn't the world we grew up in, geek culture <B>is</B> mainstream.<P>2) What the hell else could we make?  For real-world settings you've goteither historical or contemporary options.  If they're combat-focused worldsyou have only a few historically interesting settings that can bemeaningfully differentiated from Fantasy (Wild West, World Wars 1 & 2, a fewothers).  For contemporary and some historical settings, you're treading anideological and political minefield (imagine a game set in the CivilWar....).  To really make games that don't center on combat but insteadfocus on more subtle forms of conflict, we've got a hell of a lot yet tolearn, so much we can't even define the problem yet.<P>Let's suppose that only 5% of the population of the US and Europe is evergoing to be interested in the games that we know how to make.  Let's furthersuppose that we will not break out of the ghetto, and learn how to makeradically different games, for the forseeable future.  Let's assume that wewon't see any significant change in the business model, and each subscriberwill be worth about $225 a year (a $15/month subscription plus one boxedunit per year)  Let's go even further and assume that the Asian andUS/European markets will continue to be separate markets with little to nocrossover.  Then our market potential is only somewhere in the neigborhoodof 60 *million* subscribtions, and under the current business model thattranslates into a $15,000,000,000 (15 <B>billion</B> dollars) a yearindustry employing roughly 75,000-100,000 people.  Yeesh, the "Geek Ghetto"looks like a pretty ritzy neighborhood to me.<P>And I think 5% is definitely low-balling when you look at the nextgeneration, that grew up with consoles and PC's as just part of thefurniture.  Those kids are growing up, and when they have money of their ownto spend on social play they aren't going to start bowling and golfing liketheir parents.  When you look at potential refinements of the business modelsuch as exemplified by the online versions of Collectible Card Games and by"pay for stuff" models, and figure that we may be able to extract 2 to 5times as much money per subscriber, then you have to wonder why, when ourindustry is undergoing such phenomenal growth while servicing the geekghetto, are we so concerned about being "stuck" there?<P>We need to stop being embarassed of our games, and start embracing theirsettings and niches openly.  And in fact, the very companies and designersthat are decrying the limitations of the "geek ghetto" are making games withstormtroopers and elves and superheroes.  Don't throw me into thatgold-plated briar patch....<P>
