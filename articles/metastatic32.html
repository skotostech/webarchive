							<p>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">It's been around eight months, give or take, since I started working on 
this weekly column.  I've put quite a few words up that I hope some of yhou 
have found interesting, and in doing so I've learned a few things about 
games that I otherwise might have ignored.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Having said all that, it's time to (temporarily!) put MetaStatic on 
hiatus.  I'm getting close to releasing the first stage of <I>Horizon 
Station</I>, and I need to focus my creative energies solely on that task.  
It's not going to be the finished game, but it will be there to give those 
of you that are interested a taste of things to come.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Once the first few runs of <I>Parts</I>, the initial stage for HS, are 
over, I'll start writing MetaStatic again.  Phase Two of this column will be 
much more tightly focused on the problems and challenges encountered in 
implementing Horizon Station, and will serve, I hope, as a sort of guidebook 
for future storybuilders.  Skotos has given us some powerful tools, and I 
think a look into the process of their use will be useful for all 
concerned.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">That said, I'll give you a short list of the challenges that myself, and 
the Horizon volunteers, are going to face.  Brace yourself, this could get 
ugly.</font></P>
								<H4><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">The Environment</font></H4>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">There are, at last count, more than eighty types of room in Horizon 
Station.  This does not include the miles of corridor necessary to link all 
those rooms together.  Or the fact that each room will have to appear more 
than once, and that each time the room will have to be slightly different, 
so as not bore the audience.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">On average, each type of room will have five elements that can provide 
interaction.  A well-designed room will also have another <I>ten or 
twenty</I> details that are there for only for flavor.  So we're up to, 
let's see, at least 400 interactive elements, and at least 800 descriptive 
elements.  But wait, there's more.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Because the entire game environment is built to be repaired (and to break 
down) each of the 400 interactive elements I've discussed above will be 
constructed out of even smaller pieces.  To be conservative, I'd say there 
are going to be at least a thousand of these, and perhaps as many as twice 
that number.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">And that's just the core environment.</font></P>
								<H4><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">The Game</font></H4>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Into this detailed environment I'm going to have to build the game rules. 
  Most of this is going to be constructed out of scripts that are embedded 
in the various objects of the game.  Which means one mistake in a 'parent' 
object, can quickly become a thousand mistakes scattered across many 'child' 
objects.  Kinda spooky.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">This is not rocket science, but it is going to involve some fairly tricky 
scripting and a lot of planning to make sure things work right.  It's going 
to be a challenge.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Fortunately, I am planning on deploying the game in a number of phases, 
each of which will add another gameplay element to those that have gone 
before.  The first phase will involve repairing the station, and phases 
after that will cover combat, space exploration, and whatever other wacky 
ideas cross my mind in the dark of the night.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Putting the game into the environment is the hardest task, and one that 
I'm as excited about as I am nervous.  Mainly because of all the happy 
players that I'm likely to irritate.  Which brings me to ...</font></P>
								<H4><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">The Audience</font></H4>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">The environment and the game are difficult, no two ways about that.  They 
both involve a lot of work, a lot of trial and error, and a lot of 
troubleshooting.  But these two things are nothing compared to what will 
happen when the players appear on the scene.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Players have it easy.  They show up and have a good time.  And if they 
don't, they break out the flamethrowers and start lighting up the screaming 
developers.  Developers hate flamethrowers, they sting.  And I don't have 
that much bactine.</font></P>
								<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Which is why I spend days and nights thinking about what players do, what 
kinds of things they look for, and how much they love to break games.  It's 
an exhausting exercise, but it's the only way to get things done.</font></P>
							<P><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">And with that said, I leave you for now, to go and put together the first 
stage for your enjoyment.  See you in a few weeks.  I'll still be checking 
the forums, of course, so feel free to click that little link  below.</font></P>
