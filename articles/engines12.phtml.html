            <h2>Nuts and Bolts </h2>
            <p><i><b>by Dave Rickey<br>

My original intention when I started this column was to focus on the craftof designing online games, an intention I didn't do the best job offollowing up on. Various theoretical and meta-design issues kept coming tomy attention, and I would feel I just had to write about them. However,there <i>are</i> a lot of issues of craft that need to be discussed, and I reallywanted to start working through my list of them.<P>So when Terra Nova invited me to become one of their contributors, I decidedto take them up on their offer. With their academic focus it's a moreappropriate forum for theoretical and philosophical discussions, and theformat will let me write those pieces when I feel the urge, while being ableto let someone else carry the ball when I really don't have anything worthsaying.<P>So on that note, I'm going to focus this column on a very "nuts and bolts"issue: Engines.<p>An amazing amount of the work that goes into developing anMMO is typically spent developing fundamental technology: graphics engines,network support, server-side data storage, user interface API's, and otherbasic pieces of the games. Of all the major games out there, only one didnot build their technology from scratch; my former home, Dark Age ofCamelot, liscensed the NetImmerse (now Gamebryo) graphics engine from NDL,built their server on top of the text MUD engine they had been using formore than a decade, and adapted UI technology they had used for other games.The sum result of this was that the game went from prototype to storeshelves in 18 months, less than half the typical time for an MMO (andcomparing well with most AAA single-player titles).<P>As I have been alluding, MMO games don't need a single engine, they needseveral, and developing all that technology from scratch is expensive,time-consuming, and potentially a stumbling block for the entire project. Itcan take a year or more to develop the core technology for an MMO, and atthe end of that time you still don't have a game--you have (if you're lucky)a framework you hope you can build a game on. Meanwhile, your designers havehad a year of operating in a vacuum, keeping themselves occupied by buildingever more elaborate and complicated plans, with no way of connecting whatthey want with what the core technology will be able to do. Once thetechnology is finally ready, the race is on to actually build the game andhave something to show for all that work, and those elaborate plans rarelyhave fallback positions to allow for the inevitable compromises.<P>The thing is, we're not in the technology business, we're in theentertainment business. Our entertainment product is inherentlytechnological in nature, but it's not the technology that sells the boxesanymore. It's time we stop re-inventing the wheel for every project, andstart buying them off the rack. Fortunately, there are a variety of wheelson the market for us to choose from.<P>For our purposes, there are basically three core pieces of technology an MMOneeds, that they don't neccessarily have to build:<P><OL><LI>Graphics Engine</LI><LI>Server Data Storage</LI><LI>Server Game Logic/Architecture</LI></OL><P><B>Graphics Engines</B><P>Odds are extremely high that you are not John Carmack (I don't think hereads my column). Odd are almost as high that you are not a graphicsprogrammer in John Carmack's league (there are no more than a few dozen inthe world). And it's pretty likely that you don't work with anybody that isreally that good. So, given that the expectations for graphics engineperformance the customer has are set by those who are operating on thatrarified plane, can you really expect to deliver what the customer expectsin terms of capability, performance, and stability? Not completely arhetorical question; some of you can honestly answer "Yes", but odds are youcan't. Given that high-quality graphics engines are such a black art, it'sprobably better to buy the capability from specialists than to try to buildit.<P>The obvious first place to look is at the <ahref="http://www.idsoftware.com/business/home/technology/techlicense.php">Quake 3 Arena engine</a> from the man himself. That engine represents the"Gold Standard" against which all others are judged. Unfortunately, thenumber of licensees is capped, so you probably can't get it. I'm not goingto try to give a comprehensive list of alternatives, or a full discussion oftheir capabilities, but just hit some of the high points:<P><a href="http://www.ndl.com/gamebryo_engine.cfm">Gamebryo</a>, formerlyNetImmerse.<P>Obviously I have a bias towards this engine, it's been at the core of mylast two projects. It's a very flexible engine that has been used foreverything from FPS to RTS to Racing titles. The license does cost asignificant amount, but the support is excellent and the engine is solid. Inaddition to Camelot, Gamebryo is being used by <ahref="http://www.mutablerealms.com/">my current employer</a> and byCodemasters for <ahref="http://www.codemasters.com/dragonempires/uk/">Dragon Empires</a>,making it the most used engine for MMO's. This has its drawbacks: all threegames show a similarity of appearance that probably derives from how theengine handles animated models.<P><a href="http://www.touchdownentertainment.com/">Jupiter</a>, formerly"LithTech".<P>This is a fully featured engine, but like most it was developed primarilyfor FPS games with an emphasis on extremely high quality animated models andcomparatively low geometry counts. However, it has been used for onelesser-known MMO, <a href="http://www.rubiesofeventide.com/">Rubies ofEventide</a>, so the technology is adaptable to the purpose. As Iunderstand, it has some of the more flexible licensing terms and morecapable integrated tools.<P><a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/">Unreal</a><P>This is a major engine that is available for license, but it has been usedalmost exclusively for FPS titles, and has all of the limitations that gowith the type. For the right title, it could certainly deliver visuals andperformance comparable to anything on the market, but the client, server,and network code are tightly integrated and would probably requiresignificant rebuilding for the needs of an MMO.<P><a href="http://www.garagegames.com/pg/product/view.php?id=1">Torque</a><P>Originally developed for Tribes 2, unlike most FPS engines T2 was mostly setin an outdoor setting with both ground and air vehicles. It also has thelowest up-front cost of any of the commercial engines: $100 per seat. Theone catch is that the royalty structure for MMO games would have to benegotiated, and Garage Games primary focus is on "Independent" games withlower volumes. Assuming reasonable license terms could be worked out, theengine could probably be adapted to a large variety of MMO types.<P><ahref="http://crystal.sourceforge.net/tikiwiki/tiki-view_articles.php">Crystal Space</a><P>You can't get cheaper than free. The catch with Crystal Space is that it isliscensed under the LGPL, which means that any game built using it wouldhave to distribute its source code for the client to any player that asked,and probably the source code for the server to any partners that operatedservers (unless the server was separately developed from scratch, ratherthan adapted). However, for small scale independent projects involving smallbudgets and small staffs, this engines might be an attractive alternative tothe Torque engine. Also, the OSS process has the potential to significantlyimprove this engine, and it may become a much more solid platform in thefairly near future.<P><B>Data Storage</B><P>In my discussion of graphic engines, some may feel I slighted the open source alternatives to commercialproducts. I suspect OSS advocates will be somewhat more pleased with myassessment of data storage alternatives:<P><a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a><P>There's little question that Oracle is the best performing RDBMS system onthe market. It runs on platforms ranging from X86 to custom-builtsupercomputers, and is the most feature-complete options available for anydata-management function. It is also the most expensive, and requiresexpensive specialists for administration. I would dismiss Oracle out of handas a Cadillac solution for pickup truck problem, but it was used for StarWars Galaxies. Those without the LucasArts deep pockets to draw on willprobably want to look elsewhere.<P><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.asp">Microsoft SQLServer</a><P>Not as high-performance, high-reliability, or feature-complete as Oracle, the Microsoft SQL Serveris a lot cheaper and much easier to license. You can buy it off the shelfand use it as a commodity solution without much fear of complications. It'sa workable choice, and at least one MMO game I am contractually obligatednot to specify used it for their game server data storage. However, itsprimary recommendation for use is "No one ever got fired for buyingMicrosoft".<P><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a><P>MySQL is an OSS product that also comes in a commercially licensed andsupported version. In either form, it has both strengths and weaknesses.High on the list of strengths is low cost and good performance for certainkinds of data access, on the down side it is fairly limited in features andrequires a particular kind of programmer with the right skills to get thebest performance from it. The greatest strength is that if your architectureis set up right, you can stretch performance a long way simply by throwingmore hardware at the problem. (Out of the money you saved vs. buying one ofthe above, you can buy a lot of hardware.) Dark Age of Camelot uses MySQLfor a variety of functions.<P><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a><P>Another OSS product with a commercial variant, PostgreSQL is somewhat richerin features but lower in overall performance than MySQL. In my personaljudgement as a former client/server programmer, the tradeoff comes down infavor of PostgreSQL, but the case can be made for either and the specificimplementation could tip the balance either way.<P><B>Game Server</B><P>There used to be a proven MMO game server architecture on the market fromTurbine. However, it has apparently been withdrawn and no proven MMO serverengine is now available.<P><a href="http://www.butterfly.net/">Butterfly.net</a><P>Backed by IBM's Grid architecture, Butterfly has impressive technology, buta potentially restrictive set of conditions. The grid itself is owned byIBM, and there is potential trouble down the road when it is time torenegotiate contracts. (You can't exactly threaten to take your customers tosome other implementation of Butterfly on someone else's grid computinginfrastructure.) To solve the chicken-or-egg problem, an initiative to offerfree service and support for academics who want to use games for researchwas recently announced. Potentially this is a huge opportunity to leveragethe assets of one of the world's largest technology companies.<P><a href="http://www.zona.net/">TeraZona</a><P>TeraZona was all over GDC last year, sponsoring a special track on MMOtechnology. However, since no-one I've spoken with seems to have attended, Iknow almost nothing about their technology.<P><a href="http://www.zeroc.com/">ICE</a><P>(Disclosure Note: Not only does Wish use ICE for its server, but several ofthe programmers and executives are former employees of ZeroC, the companythat developed it)<P>Another OSS+Commercial product, ICE is a general-purposedistributed-computing architecture that can be adapted for MMO servers. It'sa mixture of C++ and Java, and runs natively on Linux.<P><b>Conclusion</b><P>Of these three, there's absolutely no reason you should build your own foranything but the server architecture. It simply makes no sense to spendmoney rebuilding the core functionality essential to a game, when making thegame is quite difficult enough in itself. For the server architecture, theneeds of an MMO are unique enough that rolling your own may be justified, ifyou have the budget to support it. Even there, the option of using anoutside package should be considered.<P>
