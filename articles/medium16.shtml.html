<p>Lately, I've hit a slump that happens to many players who have been
at this hobby for several years. It just seems like everything has
been done. When you're looking at yet another [insert genre here]
game, and it looks just like the previous one, only the names have
been changed, it's hard to dredge up the enthusiasm and objectivity to
look at it as anything new and interesting -- especially when it draws
the same players, with the same types of characters and the same old
plots and motivations.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be like that, though. We've only
scratched the surface of the potential for this medium, not only in terms of
code use and staff structure (check out Unused Potential, the second article in
this series), but also in dealing with themes, settings, and the way stories
are told. In the search of the perfect game, I've realized there is no such
thing, but it did bring to mind a lot of ideas that I'd love to see get used.
Some of them may already exist out there, and if so, all the better. If they
do, let me know. It'd make a certain columnist very happy -- these are my
personal favorites among the ranks of nonexistent games.</p>

<h3>Discworld</h3>

<p>Terry Pratchett owns me. If you've never read his Discworld
series, then as soon as you finish this article, log out and go to your local
library to check out <i>The Colour of Magic</i>. It's the first in a long and
ongoing series of brilliant humor. To my knowledge, there has never been a MU*
set in Discworld. This is a crime. I don't think the reason for this is that
the Discworld is all that obscure. I've met many players who are familiar with
it. So if there are so many Discworld fans out there, why isn't there a game
based on it?</p>

<p>Well, first of all, it would be difficult. The setting
itself isn't the heart of the material. It's Pratchett's wit and insight that
brings it alive. The challenge for anyone making a game like this would be
capturing Pratchett's gift of parody while keeping the scope of the game within
the realm of playability for the common player. I'd like to think that there
are enough witty people out there in MU*dom to make a go of it, though. Set
aside the established storylines and characters from the books; there are a
million untold stories to be explored. With a group of original characters, a
storyteller could draw plot material from the setting and go with it. That's
the beauty of the Discworld; you can take a handful of characters, thrust them
into one uncanny adventure after another, and still stay perfectly within
theme. Forget realism. It's the Discworld.</p>

<p>A well done Discworld MU* would have me there in a
heartbeat. Unfortunately, a badly done Discworld MU* would call for nothing
less than to burn the machine it's on to the ground, pour the ashes into a lead
lined box, and bury them somewhere in the Antarctic, then taking an oath to
never speak of it again. It's a risk I'm willing to take. If I ever see
Ankh-Morpork by Night, I'm there.</p>

<h3>Original Modern Horror</h3>

<p>I'm a fan of modern horror. You might therefore guess, and
be absolutely correct, that I've spent a good portion of my RP time on games
set in the Word of Darkness system by White Wolf. It's not necessarily a bad
setting, and there was a time when it was cutting edge and brand new, but that
time has long past. Not only have I not seen anything new and exciting coming
out of WoD MU*s in a long time, but I haven't seen many players who even <i>want</i>
something new. They want an established setting they know, where they can play
types of characters with which they're familiar, in an atmosphere they
understand. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this, but it's not what I
want.</p>

<p>I want to see modern horror done from the angle of the
hapless mortal. Forget supernatural politics and trying to understand the
monster within, I want to get scared as hell by the monster within, and then go
after the monster without armed with a stake, a gun loaded with silver bullets,
a flamethrower, and a super-soaker full of holy water. I want my character to
worry that staking a vampire, decapitating it, burning it to ashes, and
scattering the ashes over a twenty mile radius might not be enough to stop it.
There is a delicious sense of fear and paranoia that goes along with well done
horror, and I'm just not seeing it in World of Darkness these days.</p>

<p>In part, I think this is because that's not why most people
play WoD anymore, if in fact that was ever a motivation to begin with. In WoD
you are the monster, and you're one of many monsters who bicker and politic in
the shadows while the mortal world goes on unaware. I enjoyed the angle in
Vampire: the Masquerade, where your character was a relatively young vampire in
danger of losing what's left of his/her humanity. There was a struggle there,
and the stakes were high -- so to speak. I haven't seen that played in a long
time. Anymore, it's all about the power fantasy. Being a monster isn't tragic,
it's a good excuse to have 133+ p0w3rz and throw your weight around.</p>

<p>I want to be scared by horror again. I want monsters to be
more than just a set of rules in a gaming supplement somewhere. Part of what
makes horror interesting is the element of the unknown, and that's been lost in
the WoD, because there aren't anymore unknowns save for what you make up
yourself. I figure if you're going to do that, you may as well just start from
scratch. There are a dozen different ways to interpret vampires, werewolves,
fairies, and ghosts: White Wolf's take is merely one of many. Since WW's take
has been explored so thoroughly, I wouldn't mind seeing someone else's version for
a change.</p>

<h3>Lovecraft</h3>

<p>Speaking of horror, I would love to see a game based off the
writings of H.P. Lovecraft. While modern horror is good, I'm also interested in
recent past horror. Something out of the turn of the century, the 1920s, or
even as late as the 1950s would fascinate me. The idea of setting a game in a
quaint little East Coast town in the mid-1920s -- where beneath the thin veneer
of civilization lurks horrors untold -- makes my shriveled, jaded gamer's heart
all aflutter.</p>

<p>The problem is that the elements that would make this
setting fascinating would also make it difficult to play. This is a problem any
historical setting runs into -- values were different way back when. Players are
dealing with a set of moral and social consequences with which they aren't
familiar, and some of them go against the grain of the values that have been
instilled in us. Not only are these historical values difficult to grasp, but
the idea of playing them might not appeal to a conscientious player.</p>

<p>Racism and sexism, for example, were the norm in the olden
days of ignorance and repression. Speaking out against authority was a
dangerous thing to do, and the freedom of speech and religion only applied if
you were saying and believing the right things. Not everyone is comfortable
playing this, but to lose it would be to lose a distinct flavor of the setting,
and an essential part of the social makeup that made these periods in history
what they were.</p>

<p>Of course there have always been people who have resisted
mainstream ignorance and injustice, but to make a setting like this work,
characters would have to tread carefully. Not only are there monsters lurking
under the city by night, but there are monsters lurking in government offices
and police stations by day. With the right group of players, it could work, but
they would have to understand the historical context and be willing to immerse
themselves in it for the sake of bringing the period alive.</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is just a small sampling of what I'd like to see. I
could write a column unto itself dedicated to game ideas I'd jump on in a
heartbeat. Though I show a distinct favoritism toward horror settings, there
are a wide range of genres and themes that perk my interest. A fantasy theme
that deviates from D&amp;D, for example, would rock my world. More original
settings of any stripe would be a breath of fresh air. In these jaded days,
anything that hasn't been done to death would look good. The point is that
there are endless possibilities, and I think the medium would benefit from
veering away from what's been done and venturing into uncharted territory.</p>
