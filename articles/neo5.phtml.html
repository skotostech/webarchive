<p>  If you've spent any time reading MUD forums, you'veseen posts  about 'real' innovation and originality.  It wasprobably part  of a post about how this or that MUD is totallyoriginal and  vastly innovative.  This was probably followed byhow many  classes and races they were going to have, to provehow clever  and original the MUD would be.  The implication isthat it's far  more clever and innovative to have 137 classes thanonly six or  seven.</p><p>  Most MUDs making these claims wind up as bad clonesof the  codebase they started from.  Most of the classes andraces wind  up being nearly indistinguishable from each other. If you have  137 classes, it means you don't have enough time todo even one  or two of them very well.  In fact, if you're juststarting to  open your MUD, six or seven classes is still toomany to do  well.</p><p>  New combat spells with slightly different names andstrings are  not, in my book, innovation.  Dividing the classesinto  (effectively) priests, mages, warriors and thievesand then  having a vast number of 'in-between' classes thatget some  combination of their powers from the other four alsoisn't  innovation.  Dividing mage classes up so that no onemage gets  all the spells?  Still not innovation.  Classlesssystem?  Well,  if that means starting the character with theability to gain  skills from, effectively, those four classes andmake his own  class by combining bits from all four...?</p><p>  I could talk all day about the various things youcould steal  from Dungeons and Dragons to add to a DikuMUD thataren't real  innovation.  Rather than that, I'll talk about somegenuinely  interesting and unusual things that certain MUDs aredoing.  These things might not be utterly unlike anythingelse out  there, but they're done well, they work well, andthey aren't  like most MUDs.</p><h3> Tonight's Special is... </h3><p>  Changes of setting and atmosphere may not be  &quot;original&quot; in the sense of being a wholenew category  that nobody has ever explored before.  But theyoften feel new  and different if they're done well, and they openthe door to  things that MUDs rarely do, things that are moreeffective in  combination than individually.</p><p>  <a href="http://www.theinquisition.net">TheInquisition MUD</a>  (now past tense?) had a fairly generic, if dark,fantasy  setting.  Their classes were relativelyDiku-standard, and most  of their mobiles were nothing enthralling, thoughthe mobiles  <i>did</i> have nice mobile scripts and the MUD<i>did</i> have  good builders.  Inquisition was a veryroleplaying-centered MUD,  and roleplaying was effectively mandatory forhigher-level  characters.  Their biggest change to the setting,however, was  magic.  They didn't just make magic rare...  Theymade it  illegal!  Mage characters were very difficult toplay, and you  had to apply specially to be allowed to.  Mages hadto be  careful to never reveal their powers, or they'd beshunned or  killed for having those powers.  This provided anentirely  different flavor to the MUD, even with fairlyordinary game  features and game mechanics.</p><p>  <a href="http://discworld.imaginary.com">DiscWorldMUD</a> also  does a few interesting and atmospheric things withrelatively  simple and common mechanics.  Its guilds -- wizard,witch,  thief, assassin, warrior, priest -- follow thetraditional  molds.  However, each is significantly differentfrom its  stereotype, and each cleaves closely to the books onwhich the  MUD is based.  Witches get powers like 'taunt',which reduce an  opponents stats, or 'bees' which involves throwinghoney on an  enemy and letting bees arrive and sting them. Priests can  sacrifice in various unusual ways.  Thieves stealfrom you...  But if they're part of the thieves guild, they leavea reciept!</p><p>  <a href="http://www.cm.foxpaws.net">CthulhuMUD</a>,which  recently moved to a new URL, is another fine exampleof a  well-executed setting.  The MUD is set in thevarious stories of  H.P. Lovecraft.  CthulhuMUD, like Inquisition, isdone on a base  derived from DikuMUD.  While CthulhuMUD is mostly acombat MUD,  they have some additional game mechanics thatsupport the feel  of a Lovecraft story.  Classes for humans are mainlythings like  student, soldier, policeman, cadet or artist...  Theplayer  organizations include the Order of Dagon, and usedto include  the U.S. Marines.</p><p>  Anonymity is relatively common in CthulhuMUD --certain nonhuman  races start with the ability to take the form of anyNPC, for  instance, making them hard to spot and letting themblend in.  Masks allow you to appear only as 'a masked human'or 'a masked  deep one'.  All of these things are supported bygame mechanics,  so a PC taking the form of a french exchange studentappears in  all ways to be such a student.  You can probablytell the  &quot;exchange student&quot; is actually a player,but you can't  tell <i>who</i> that player is unless s/he tells youexplicitly  (and chooses not to lie).</p><p>  CthulhuMUD also has sanity rules.  If you fighttruly horrific  creatures, your character will tend to become lessstable, and  will begin to run away on his own, or freeze andshake with  fear.  Eventually you can even lose the character tolow sanity.  Sanity, unlike hit points, is very expensive torestore.  Few  skills bring it back, therapists are error-prone andvery  expensive, and it doesn't come back on its own overtime.  This  also adds to the creepy feeling of being surroundedby lethal  horrors (some of them other players!) in atremendously  unfriendly cosmos.</p><p>  And finally, CthulhuMUD has debating, a sort ofnonlethal combat  conducted for experience and skill points with NPCslike  professors who might reasonably be able to debate. I'll explain  that in more detail, though, in a few weeks, when Idiscuss  noncombat competitions in MUDs.</p><h3> Hey, Bob, Gimme the Usual </h3><p>  Now let's look at some less-innovative settings. Some MUDs will  tell you that restringing a standard Diku with adifferent  setting, like the &quot;Smurf Village&quot; stockzone, is  innovative.  It doesn't feel that way to theplayers, though.  In general, a setting which is just a chance to killthe same  old monsters with slighty different names isn't allthat  different.</p><p>  Put it this way: you could do a Harry Potter MUDwhere you  started by killing spiders and students of otherhouses, and  moved on to killing big spiders and students likeRon and  Hermione (and eventually professors, I suppose) fromthe books.  But why?  You've sacrificed the feel of the booksentirely, and  what you've produced is no different from fiftyother MUDs,  except for the fact that the big baddies have nameslike  Voldemort and Dumbledore.  Adding four differentmage classes  for the four different houses doesn't help, believeme.  <i>(I  know of no MUD like this.  If there is one, I'm notspecifically  knocking it.  <b>Your</b> Harry Potter Diku-basedMUD might be just  fine for all I know.  Okay?)</i></p><p>  Unfortunately, this practice seems to be even moreprevalent  with combat-heavy settings like Tolkien.  Did younotice that  Gandalf never threw a fireball in all the variousbooks, ever?  And that he used a sword?  And that even at theirmost warlike,  the heroes were never really on a dungeon crawl,killing  creature after creature?  There was Moria, but theywent through  that at a dead run, and their enemies had<i>strategy</i>.  Tolkien is probably the setting that MUDs are mostclosely  modeled after.  Yet even then, most of theatmosphere and  setting is stripped out.  I'm not saying therearen't technical  reasons for the practice (it <i>is</i> easier tojust make all  your monsters vicious and stupid).  I'm justpointing out that  MUD administrators seem to have forgotten thatcurrent MUDs  remove most of the interesting parts of theirsubject matter  &mdash; even the MUDs that are truest to it.</p><h3> Our Chef's Special </h3><p>  I'm not going to talk much about originality.  Ithink as long  as an implementor is coming up with somethinginteresting and  entertaining, and preferably not common among MUDs,it's a good  thing.  Genuinely new, unique ideas for MUDmechanics are  practically impossible at this point.  The way Iusually say it  is &quot;no matter what new idea you come up withfor MUDs,  there's a man somewhere that came up with it first. That man's  name is J.C. Lawrence&quot;.  That's actually funnyif you read  <ahref="http://www.kanga.nu/archives/MUD-Dev-L/">MUD-Dev</a>.  You'll have to take my word for it.</p><p>  A ridiculous number of concepts have already beenproposed and  written in one place and another.  Very few haveever been put  into free MUD codebases, including whichevercodebase you're  starting from.  So expect to retrace a lot of otherpeople's  steps.  Being utterly original is nearlyimpossible...</p><p>  So don't bother.  Be entertaining, be reliable, bethe first to  put it in a MUD server or the first to make freecode available  for a particular feature.  You don't have to be thefirst person  to ever think of it.  There's still glory aplenty inbuilding  these ideas into somthing usable.  And that's glorythat nobody  has yet claimed.  Don't cry over what you can'tthink of first.  Instead, have fun with what you can <i>do</i> first.</p><h3> What's in Fourteen? </h3><p>  In fourteen days, I'll go back to coveringprocedural content  generation, but in a little more detail.  I'lljustify some of  the opinions I put forth in that column.  I'llelaborate more on  exactly how procedural content generation spreadsyour content  thin, and some problems with upgrading.</p><p>  See you then!</p>
