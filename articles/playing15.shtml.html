							<h2>Artisans in Historical Fiction II: Jewellery &amp; Weaponry</h2>
							<p><i><b>by Michael Karlin<br>
										September 5, 2003</b></i></p>

<p><i>"I had very good dentures once. Some magnificent gold work. It's
the only form of jewelry a man can wear that women fully appreciate."<br>
- Graham Greene, novelist.</i>

<p>Civilisations were propelled into progression at the discovery of
metal. Flint knives could cut through animal hides more efficiently
and kept their sharp edges longer than their stone
counterparts. Metals could be heated to great temperatures and mixed
in certain volumes to form others, such as bronze, or to remove
impurities that compromise the integrity of the metal, such as
iron. Metals had many uses in the ancient, medieval and renaissance
worlds, most notably in the use of jewellery and the mechanisms of
war. They are arguably more important to the historical world than
they are today, as many tasks accomplished in our daily lives once
achieved through metallic items are being replaced by superior
carbon-based or plastic-based materials. I do not hesitate to opine
that the supremacy of metal is a bygone concept.

<h3>Beauty of the Earth</h3>

<p>Jewellery can come in many incarnations all dedicated to relating a
certain image to the viewer. Jewellery is not about accenting the
body's natural beauty like a cosmetic; it specialises in adding to the
natural human beauty. As animals rarely adorn themselves or keep
trophies of their kills, jewellery seems to me to be a symbol of the
human mastery over its immediate environment.


<p>At first the use of animal remains were used to display cunning or
prowess at a time where the success of sustenance hunting meant life
or death. The success of the hunt meant the fortunate welfare of the
familial unit or tribe, and thus the person's stature as a life-giver
was outlined by trophies of their conquests: bones, teeth and nails of
fallen prey bleached by the sun and strung together by sinew. The
importance of this relatively savage display of cunning waned as
humanities consolidated into larger communities fed by the produce of
the field. Concurrent innovations regarding the use of certain metals
and the cutting and polishing of precious stones led to the innovation
of jewellery's key ingredient: intricacy. Crafting a piece of
jewellery is particularly difficult because it requires very still
hands and the ability to work under magnification.


The most important aspect of jewellery creation in an online game is the recognition of what was possible in that place at that time. Most materials were available, but were they able to be cut or fashioned properly? Egypt had an incredible amount of gold at their disposal, and since gold melts quickly and may be fashioned easily, gold jewellery was commonplace in their society. However, the amount of precious or semi-precious stones available were limited because of their limited trade routes and limit on the technology that would allow them to cut precious stones. The existence of diamond jewellery in ancient Egypt is a massive anachronism that we will not be adding to our game.

<p>Lastly, jewellery may have a religious or symbolic significance
greater than anything else crafted by a human being. The Egyptians
empowered their amulets with prayers and blessings from priests in
order to give it deific powers. This would make amulets charms of
luck, health or divine protection.

<p><b>A few things to keep in mind:</b>

<ul><li>Take note of any cultural superstition that would identify a
certain stone or metal as especially holy or taboo,

<li>Take note of supply and demand differences in your culture as
opposed to the setting of your game. In modern Western civilisation,
gold is more precious than silver. In ancient Egypt, this is quite the
opposite because silver is much rarer in their society,

<li>Take note of any special symbolism a piece of jewellery has in
your setting. Remember that a gold ring on the fourth finger does not
denote marriage in every society or historical setting.
</ul>

<h3>With this Fine Creation, I Strike You Down</h3>

<p>The evolution of weaponry in history was driven by the desire for a
soldier to kill his or her enemy with greater efficiency and with less
vulnerability to themselves. Starting with the club and other blunt
objects, melee weaponry was perfected with the sword. What made the
sword so perfect was its versatility; with it, one can cut like an axe
and thrust like a spear. Add to that features that made it relatively
lightweight, well-balanced and compact and the result is the ultimate
killing utensil. Swords did come in many different lengths, weights,
sizes and adornments, but the concept was fairly universal around the
world. In fact, weaponry is one area that the world first experienced
a rudimentary version of globalisation. If an enemy carried a weapon
vastly superior to yours, you would either adapt and use it yourself
or you would die. This is why swords, spears, gunpowder weapons and
surface-to-air missiles are proliferated worldwide. The ancient
Egyptians were no exception to this; part of the reason that they were
conquered by the Asiatic Hyksos people was the latter's use of the chariot. Not only did the Egyptians blatantly take the technology for their own, but they combined it with their use of the composite bow to decisively defeat the invaders. They adapted, whereas the Aztecs, who succumbed to the Spanish use of horses and guns, did not. Therefore, the use of certain weaponry over others is very much a temporal issue over a geographic one.

<p>Bear in mind that the introduction of certain weapons may drastically
affect a civilisation. Life has not been the same since atomic weapons
obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Gunpowder changed the nature of
inter-band conflict of the Aboriginals of North America, and the
invention of the stirrup allowed the Mongol Empire to sweep through
Europe.

<p><b>A few things to keep in mind:</b>

<ul><li>What weaponry is used in your setting? Is it indigenous or
imported? If imported, what is the history behind that?

<li>Is your setting in the midst of a "transition period," or a period
when new materials in weaponry (bronze over iron, gunpowder, rocketry)
change the dynamics of a society?

<li>Are certain weapons restricted to or from certain classes or
segments of society?
</ul>

<p>In two weeks: I'll actually talk about food or drink in history, like I promised two weeks ago.</P>
