<p>Well, it's been a long hiatus.  Lots of reasons for that, some professionaland some personal.  In the meantime, a lot of things have been happening inthe business.  Microsoft shut down the Mythica project, EA moved the UXOproject from Austin to California (leaving the senior staff behind), andrumors of trouble surround The Matrix Online.  Although there are almostcertainly many more issues involved, I think much of it can be traced backto one event: Horizons launched and didn't do well.  This, added on top of aseries of disappointments (essentially, every game launched since Asheron'sCall with the singular exception of DAOC), has the industry a littlejumpy.<P>What's frustrating is that the disappointments were not only predictable,they were predicted widely by nearly everyone who really has been watchingthe industry.  There were a few surprises: many didn't believe DAOC would doas well as it did, some expected SWG to do much better (it did have thefastest initial growth of any game ever, though).  But this is the way ofthings, a new paradigm comes along, is initially doubted, then accepted,then lauded as the next great thing and everyone jumps on the bandwagon,then tossed aside.  Everyone wants to be associated with a hot new concept;no one wants to be the last one to bail out when the going gets rough.<P>Irrational exuberance has become equally irrational pessimism.  What'sreally going on here is simple: Cloning EQ isn't going to cut it.  Theoriginal is still around, still adding more content, still updating theirgraphics engine to remain competitive.  No knockoff can simply refine the EQformula and expect to do well.  It's not even enough to recreate EQ'sgameplay in a different setting, "EQ with laser guns", "EQ in space", and soon.  A game has to bring something new to the table in terms of the gameplayexperience it provides, or it's doomed from birth.<P>But adapting a formula is easy, creating a new gameplay experience is<b>hard</b>, not to mention a big gamble.  And any time millions of dollarsare involved, risk-aversion goes with the territory.  The people who controlthe money don't understand gamers, or gaming, they look at it as a straightinvestment proposition, and they want to know, as surely as possible, thatif they pour money in one end, they'll be able to take more money out theother, and they want to understand what's going to happen in the middle,without having to spend a great deal of time actually understanding theintricacies of the process.  People with money to invest have no shortage ofplaces to put it, and a major shortage of time to choose which ones.  Sothey want simple propositions.  "EQ is hugely successful, and this game willbe just like EQ, but in space" is a simple pitch they can understand, evenif it's a bad idea.<P>And now what they see is EA, Microsoft, and Ubi Soft, three of the biggestcompanies in the market, all backing away from it.  The simple truth is thatnone of these companies really understood the market to begin with.However, these cycles are inevitable, and this being the first majordownswing it's equally inevitable that it will be the most severe.<P>
