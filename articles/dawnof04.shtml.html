							<p><b><i>by <a href="mailto:richard@mud.co.uk">Richard Bartle<br>
										</a>October 17, 2001</i></b></p>
							<p>At the end of my previous article, I left you on tenterhooks concerning what the second objection is to using multiple inheritance in MUDs.
							<p>As you&#146;ll have surmised from the above title, the second objection concerns efficiency.</p>
							<p>To inherit in a single inheritance system means searching an ordered list, because in a tree the path from a leaf to the root has no branches (unlike the path from the root to a leaf). It&#146;s fast, and it&#146;s why C++ uses single inheritance.</p>
							<p>In a multiple inheritance system, you have to search a tree (an inverted one of a node&#146;s ancestors, but a tree nevertheless). The path from a leaf to the root has branches, because multiple parents mean multiple routes, and this makes it a tree. Trees are recursive data structures and nowhere near as fast to search as a straight list.</p>
							<p>I guess I should draw a couple of diagrams to show what I mean when I say it&#146;s a tree, having gone to great lengths in the previous article to say that the overall data structure is a hierarchy...</p>
						<div align="center">
							<p><img src="artwork/dawnof4a.gif" width="181" height="253" border="0" alt="diagram"></p>
						</div>
						<div align="left">
							<p>In the above very simple hierarchy, node F wants to inherit a method that is defined at both A and C (marked with an asterisk). Because C is a subclass of A, and therefore overrides A&#146;s definition, the version F should pick is at C. The search is of a tree, because there&#146;s a choice at F as to which parent to look at first. If it looked at its parents left-to-right, the effective tree that the search for a method would follow is:</p>

							<p>If it looked at its parents right-to-left, the tree would be:</p>

							<p><img src="artwork/dawnof4c.gif" width="181" height="235" border="0" alt="diagram"></p>
						</div>
						<div align="left">
							<p>(Node A doesn&#146;t appear twice because searches stop when they reach a node they&#146;ve visited before).</p>
							<p>Alarmingly, a blind, left-to-right, depth-first search would reach the A node before the C node, which is severely wrong. In general, a depth-first search up a class hierarchy is a Very Bad Idea. A breadth-first search wouldn&#146;t necessarily be any better, either &#151; it could visit the above nodes in the order F B E A D C and would therefore also find A before C.</p>
							<p>The solution is to put a partial ordering on the nodes in the tree, so that a directed search can be performed which guarantees nodes are found in the right order (in the above example, that means F first, then E before D before C before A, also B before A; whether B is checked before E, D or C is irrelevant). The algorithm isn&#146;t all that hard to figure out for any half-decent programmer, but if enough people moan to me about it I guess I could outline it in a later article.</p>
							<p>In practice, it turns out that for the class hierarchies we see in MUDs, the directed search that we&#146;re forced to perform anyway is very efficient &#151; it can find a node almost as quickly as can the list search up a class tree. I use this approach for <i>MUD2</i>, which has 7,700 nodes in a hierarchy 16 levels deep, and it averages 5,000 to 10,000 hierarchy lookups per command. Nevertheless, the game can handle 50+ commands a second without noticeable slowdown (I&#146;ve no idea what the maximum is because I&#146;ve never tried more than 50). Frankly, if I wanted to increase the efficiency of <i>MUD2</i> then its inheritance system is one of the last places I&#146;d look to squeeze out some extra performance.</p>
							<p><b>The Case for Multiple Inheritance</b></p>
							<p>Some die-hard advocates of single-inheritance programming are so used to hacking solutions in C++ or Java that they refuse to accept that multiple inheritance is necessary. They believe that a solution can always be programmed using single-level inheritance.</p>
							<p>They&#146;re right, it can! But then, a solution can always be programmed in flat assembler. What&#146;s more, it would run faster, too. That doesn&#146;t mean it&#146;s a good idea, though... The fact is, multiple inheritance makes adding new concepts to a MUD so easy, and it extends the range of concepts that can be considered so much, that suggesting single inheritance is somehow superior is almost laughable.</p>
							<p>Single inheritance <i>is</i> marginally easier to code, but multiple inheritance is a great deal easier to code <i>with</i>. If you have a MUD with decent multiple inheritance, the chance that someone will be able to persuade you that you should switch to single inheritance is pretty damned low.</p>
							<p>Whatever you decide, however, there&#146;s another trap concerning inheritance that practically every MUD programmer who ever walked has fallen into. It concerns the word &quot;object&quot;, and I&#146;ll discuss it next time.</p>
