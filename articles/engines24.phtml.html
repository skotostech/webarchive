<I>9 And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place,and let dry ground appear." And it was so. 10 God called the dry ground"land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it wasgood. <BR>11 Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants andtrees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to theirvarious kinds." And it was so. 12 The land produced vegetation: plantsbearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed init according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. </I><BR><B>Genesis: 1; 9-12</B><P><I>One day a group of scientists got together and decided that man had comea long way and no longer needed God. So they picked one scientist to go andtell Him that they were done with Him. <BR>The scientist walked up to God and said, "God, we've decided that we nolonger need you. We're to the point that we can clone people and do manymiraculous things, so why don't you just go on and get lost?" <BR>God listened very patiently and kindly to the man. After the scientist wasdone talking, God said, "Very well, how about this? Let's say we have aman-making contest." To which the scientist replied, "Okay, great!" <BR>But, God added, "Now, we're going to do this just like I did back in the olddays with Adam." <BR>The scientist said, "Sure, no problem" and bent down and grabbed himself ahandful of dirt. <BR>God looked at him and said, "No, no, no. You go get your own dirt." <P></I>I've fallen into something of a rut, complaining about how the industry ismaking the same mistakes in the same ways (both the mistakes and mycomplaints), and it's time to break that pattern and talk about some of theways it is moving forward.<P>One of those ways is in the sheer scale of the worlds.  In scaled units, allof UO's original gameworld amounted to about 2 square miles.  EQ's originalworld was about 7 miles<sup>2</sup>.  Asheron's Call exceeded 500 miles<sup>2</sup>, but much ofthat was effectively empty (in apparent reaction to this, AC2 was 25miles<sup>2</sup>).  Dark Age of Camelot's original map was 54 miles<sup>2</sup>, Star WarsGalaxies had 8 planets of 100 miles<sup>2</sup> each, City of Heroes was roughly 50miles<sup>2</sup>, and Horizons a mind-boggling 15,000 square miles.<P>Obviously size isn't everything.  Most of AC's 500 and Horizon's 15000square miles of space is bland, uninteresting, and populated randomly (andoften sparsely) with monsters that are obviously there for no particularreason except to be there.  This space serves little gameplay purpose exceptto separate more interesting locations. The majority of the world doesn'tfeel like a world, but more like an empty stage, forgotten by the cast andignored by the audience. <P>The issue of world size is tied together with the problem of world building,and more specifically with world populating.  It is comparatively simple tocreate the terrain for a world of arbitrary size, and with the onward marchof Moore's Law it is becoming feasible to run the hundreds of thousands ofNPC's it would take to fill such a world.  But these aren't just worlds,they are games, and if the game is to be interesting then the things thatfill it need to be as well.  This creates a tension between quantity andquality of content.  Purely algorithmic methods of world building can fillworlds of arbitrary size, but tend to have uninteresting, bland results.Purely hand-built worlds are more interesting and engaging, but highly laborintensive (World of Warcraft is rumored to have spent most of its $25Mbudget on just that).  The road forward is largely a matter of improving thetools to automate as much of the process as feasible while still maintainingthat spark of creativity that comes from human effort.  This tension goesback to the roots of MMO games in MUD's, and is thrown into sharp relief inthe modern games where payroll for artists and world builders represents thebulk of development costs.<P>Ultima Online was originally a highly procedural world, with the plan ofbeing based on a virtual ecology system where content would be created byemergent systems.  The theory was that as the player's interacted with theworld, they would create interesting situations that they would then have toresolve (players kill the wolves, which increases the sheep population,which attracts dragons, and so on).  There were three basic problems withthis:<P><UL><LI>Too many top predators.  The world was originally planned around a peakplayer population of 300, when the game went live 5 times this number ofpeople were online at peak.  These players spread across the world in a waveof destruction, depopulating the world of wolves, sheep, dragons, andanything else that could be killed.</LI><LI>Instability.  Ecologies are not stable, in fact they are in a constantstate of flux and dynamic equilibrium.  Any virtual ecology operating byrealistic principles would be easily destroyed by the actions of players,even in comparatively small numbers.</LI><LI>Too much CPU.  If your ecology is operating by strict simulation rules,with large scale results emerging from the interactions of events at thesingle creature level, then you're simulating an awful lot of things thatno-one is actually there to see.  If the tree falls in the forest and no-oneis there to hear it, you still need to have everything nearby react to thesound.</LI></UL>Seven years ago simulating an ecology <I>in silico</I> was poorlyunderstood.  Now it's a routine exercise in academic circles, and quite alot is known about how to make a robust ecology.  However, a true virtualecology would probably be a poor way to supply players with interestingcontent, since the extinction cycles of any vaguely realistic ecology areanathema to the needs of a game, which must always be able to provide theplayers with an enjoyable playing experience.  And it's probably impracticalto strictly simulate an ecology of the size and complexity required for anyreal stability.<P>EverQuest was built with different principles, every monster and NPC in EQwas placed by hand, every encounter tweaked to work with the built-increature AI in very precise ways.  Literally man-years of time were expendeddefining creatures, setting loot tables, and setting up spawns.  Thisapproach showed certain disadvantages of its own:<P><UL><LI>Fragility.  To create an encounter, dozens of different data fields hadto be set very precisely, and if any of them were set incorrectly the entireencounter could be ruined in a variety of ways (too hard, too easy, too muchor little reward, and so on).</LI><LI>Monotony.  The same creatures would consistently appear at the sameexact points and after the same exact number of minutes.</LI><LI>Low efficiency.  It took dozens of manhours to populate an EQ zone witha couple of hundred spawns.  This makes world population the bottleneck inworld building.</LI></UL>The big advantage of this approach was predictability and reliability.  Ittook a lot of manhours to create content, but you could predict and budgetfor those manhours.<P>Asheron's Call used almost purely algorithmic methods.  Terrain was createdby painting heightfields and defining climate, and these would determinecreatures that would appear in a given area.  This allowed large amounts ofterrain to be populated, filling the vast majority of AC's 500 square miles.Dungeons were also assembled from random blocks being fitted together, whichallowed hundreds of them to be built.  The drawbacks of this approachwere:<P><UL><LI>Uniformity.  Large swaths of the world, dozens of square miles in achunk, would be uniformly filled with randomly scattered and nearlyidentical monsters of a single type.</LI><LI>Irrelevance.  With such a large world, most of it uninteresting, it wasnecessary to increase running speeds to outrageous levels and maketeleporting a standard skill of all characters in order to bypass most ofthe world.</LI><LI>Unreliability.  Because creatures were placed randomly, sometimes theywere randomly placed in patterns that created fights much tougher than theplayers were really prepared to cope with. </LI></UL>Algorithmic approaches to world population can fill a lot of terrain in ahurry, but the results are only as complex and varied as the algorithmallows.<P>These three approaches to world-building each has their own advantages anddisadvantages, and each used in exclusion for a game will imprint those ontothe resulting world.  The manual approach has had the best results to date,but it has a problem with scaling.  Once the tools have been improved asmuch as feasible, the only way to build a larger world is to hire more worldbuilders and have them spend more time.  After 5 years EQ has $20M or moreinvested in content, as does DAoC, and the upcoming World of Warcraft hasmade a similar investment.  Either budgets will have to continue to climbtowards the $100M mark (probably not an option in the next decade), othermethods will be explored, or each game type is going to become theunassailable turf of two or three established games, with an entrance costtoo high to be practical.<P>The best example of the potential of the algorithmic approach is in City ofHeroes.  In CoH, the world zones are subdivided into sections that areassigned difficulty levels.  Within those sections, areas are defined ashaving certain properties (Rooftop, parking lot, warehouse, etc.).  Enemiesof various kinds are assigned to an area, and are populated into the worldat run time according to their affinity to that area.  The real innovationof the CoH approach is that these enemies do not appear as lonely, randomlyplaced singletons, but rather come in packages that have an apparentpurpose.  A street gang spawn can be a "Mugging", "Vandalism", "Burglary",and so on, and will include victims spawned for the purpose.  This can leadto some oddities (like a bunch of thugs trying to break into a bus stop),but overall it does a good job of giving verisimilitude to theencounters.<P>In the next few columns, I'm going to describe a method of world buildingthat takes from all three approaches in a way that hopefully conserves thestrengths of each while allowing them to cover each other's weaknesses.
