								<h1><b>TERMS OF SERVICE</b></h1>
							</center>
							<p>Welcome to the Skotos Technologies, Inc.&#146;s (&quot;Skotos&quot;) web site, located at <a href="../storybuilders/Intro.shtml.html">www.skotos.net</a> (the &quot;Site&quot;). Please review the following terms that will govern your use of our Site and services (&quot;Terms&quot;).</p>
							<p><b>BY CLICKING THE &quot;I ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON BELOW, YOU AGREE TO COMPLY WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE TERMS, CLICK THE &quot;I REJECT&quot; BUTTON AND DO NOT CONTINUE TO USE THIS SITE OR ANY MATERIALS CONTAINED ON IT.</b></p>
							<p><b>1. Our Services.</b> Skotos is an Internet-based service that allows you to play numerous online, multi-genre, role-playing games where the worlds, places, characters, plots and other items may be created by you, other members, Skotos or other parties (collectively, &quot;Games&quot;). In addition to the Games, we also provide bulletin boards, chat rooms and other game-related services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;).<br>

<ul>							  <li type="a">At some time in the future, Skotos' multi-game service will split into individual services for individual games. At this point, any remaining time on current subscriptions will be added to each of the individual services.</UL>
							    
								<b>2. Age Requirement.</b> You must be at least fifteen (15) years of age to use the Site, Services and Games. You represent, warrant and covenant that you meet this age requirement.<br>
								<br>
								<b>3. Access.</b> You must have access to the World Wide Web in order to use our Site, Services and Games. It is your responsibility to select, obtain and pay for any equipment (e.g., computer or modem) and services (e.g., phone line or DSL) necessary for such access.<br>
								<br>
								<b>4. Registration.</b> If you accept the Terms, Skotos will ask you to complete a registration form in order to establish your membership account. You must select a name by which to identify yourself to other members and to the Skotos staff when you use the Services (your &quot;User ID&quot;). You may not select as your User ID the name of another living person (unless it is also your name), a name for the purpose of fraud or disparagement, or a name that violates any third party&#146;s trademark right, copyright, or other proprietary right, or which Skotos deems in its sole discretion to be vulgar or otherwise offensive. Skotos reserves the right to delete any vulgar or otherwise offensive User ID, or to require you to change your User ID. You must also select a password for your account. Skotos recommends that you choose one with letters and numbers, and do not use your User ID as your password. The registration form will ask you for other information about yourself (&quot;Registration Data&quot;) which you represent and warrant is at all times true, accurate, current and complete, and which you agree to update in order to maintain as such. If you breach this representation, or Skotos has reasonable grounds to suspect that you have, Skotos has the right upon notice to suspend or terminate your account and this agreement and to refuse your current or future use of the Site, Services or Games (or any portion thereof).<br>
								<br>

							<p><b>7. Content.</b></p>
							<ol>
								<li type="a"><i>Participatory Content.</i> As part of our interactive approach, Skotos provides you with certain opportunities to submit your own ideas, text, graphics, plots, characters, feedback and other materials while you participate in the Games, bulletin boards, chat rooms and other activities in the Site or Services (collectively, &quot;Participatory Content&quot;). By submitting any Participatory Content, you represent and warrant that you are the owner of or have the right to post your Participatory Content, and your Participatory Content does not infringe the rights of any third party. You hereby grant Skotos a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, publicly display and perform any and all of your Participatory Content in all media now known or later developed. You, and not Skotos, are entirely responsible for all of your Participatory Content that you upload, post, email or otherwise transmit via the Site, Services or Games.
								<li type="a"><i>Public Content. </i>Skotos also offers you certain opportunities to create your own web pages and games to offer at no charge to the public and/or other members. By submitting any Public Content, you represent and warrant that you are the owner of or have the right to post your Public Content, and your Public Content does not infringe the rights of any third party. You hereby grant Skotos a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, publicly display and perform any and all of your Public Content in all media now known or later developed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary or the use of the word perpetual, you may remove your Public Content from the Site, Services and Games at any time your account is active and in good standing and Skotos&#146; license to your Public Content shall terminate at such time, except that you may not remove your Public Content after this agreement has terminated. Skotos and you may amend this provision by entering into a separate, written agreement. You, and not Skotos, are entirely responsible for all of your Public Content that you upload, post, email or otherwise transmit via the Site, Services or Games.
								<li type="a"><i>Third Party Content.</i> You acknowledge and agree that the Site, Services and Games contain materials owned by Skotos and its licensors (including other members), and you agree not to interfere the copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights of such parties. You agree that these rights are valid and protected in all media existing now or later developed, and that except as is explicitly provided otherwise, your use of such materials shall be governed by the copyright laws of the United States and other applicable laws.
								<li type="a"><i>Content Monitoring.</i> As a matter of policy, Skotos does not pre-screen or monitor the content that you or other members may post to the Site, Services or Games. Skotos does reserve the right to monitor all such content, and reserves the right to remove without notice any and all content that Skotos, in its sole discretion, finds offensive or otherwise objectionable. You are solely responsible, and bear the risk, for evaluating the accuracy, integrity, quality, completeness or utility of any content. Skotos makes no representations or warranties about the content appearing on the Site, Services or Games. Under no circumstances will Skotos be liable in any way for any content, including but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via the Site, Services or Games.
								<li type="a"><i>Mature Content.</i> Skotos has adopted a &quot;MATURE&quot; rating, and parts of the Site, Services and/or Games contain adult or mature content that some users may consider offensive, indecent or objectionable. While Skotos has established a list of restrictions (section 6) and may in some instances choose to monitor and take action upon inappropriate gameplay, chat or links to the Services, it is possible that at any time there may be language or other material accessible on or through the Site, Services or Games that may be offensive or objectionable to some users.
								<li type="a">Content Transmission. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Services, including your Participatory Content and Public Content, may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; and (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
								<li type="a"><i>Links.</i> The Site, Services and Games may provide links to other sites for your convenience only. Skotos does not control, is not responsible for, does not necessarily endorse and makes no representation about the materials contained at any linked site. If you choose to visit any linked Sites, Skotos recommends that you review the other site&#146;s terms of use. Skotos is not responsible for webcasting or any other form of transmission received from any linked site.
							</ol>
							<p><b>8. IDEA SUBMISSION POLICY.</b> SKOTOS AND ITS EMPLOYEES DO NOT ACCEPT OR CONSIDER UNSOLICITED IDEAS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IDEAS FOR ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS, TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCT NAMES. PLEASE DO NOT SEND SKOTOS OR ANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES ANY UNSOLICITED MATERIALS, INCLUDING ANY ARTWORK OR DEMOS. IF ANY AREA OF THE SITE, SERVICES OR GAMES INVITES YOU TO SUBMIT MATERIAL, SUCH SUBMISSION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE UNSOLICITED FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION 8 (&quot;IDEA SUBMISSION POLICY&quot;). THE PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY IS TO AVOID POTENTIAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR DISPUTES IF SKOTOS&#146; PRODUCTS OR MARKETING STRATEGIES MIGHT SEEM SIMILAR TO IDEAS SUBMITTED TO SKOTOS. SKOTOS DOES ACCEPT CERTAIN SOLICITED IDEAS PROVIDED YOU PROPERLY SUBMIT THEM THROUGH THE STORYBUILDER APPLICATION AND INCLUDE YOUR SIGNATURE. PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY MATERIAL YOU SUBMIT TO SKOTOS IN ANY MANNER WILL BE DEEMED YOUR &quot;PARTICIPATORY CONTENT&quot; AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF SECTION 7(a)(&quot;PARTICIPATORY CONTENT&quot;).<br>
								<br>
								<b>9. Your Account is Your Responsibility. </b>You are solely responsible and entirely liable for all activities conducted through your account and/or your User ID, even if your account has been compromised through no fault of your own. Skotos encourages you to maintain the confidentiality of your password, and reminds you that you do not have a license to let others use your account. You agree to notify Skotos immediately in the event your password is lost, stolen, disclosed or compromised. It is not Skotos&#146; policy to ask for your password online, and Skotos suggests that you never respond to an on-line request for your password. You acknowledge that although the Site, Services and/or Games may offer a feature that allows you to &quot;remember&quot; your password and thereby bypass the password protection, this feature makes it possible for third parties to access your account and User ID. Skotos strongly discourages the use of the password bypass feature, which will in any event be at your own risk.<br>
								<br>
								<b>10. Privacy.</b> You understand that you have no expectation of privacy with respect to your use of the Site, Services or Games, and that all communications made by or received from you may be monitored, preserved and disclosed by Skotos representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system profile data and any data related to operation of the software from any computer that logs on to the Site, Services or Games using your account. You acknowledge and agree that Skotos will report to law enforcement authorities any actions which may be considered illegal, as well as any reports it receives of such conduct. Skotos will cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity. Specifically, Skotos may disclose information about you or your Participatory Content or Public Content if Skotos has the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms; (c) respond to claims that any your Participatory Content and/or Public Content violates the rights of a third party; or (d) protect the rights, property or safety of Skotos, its members or the public. These Terms are also subject to <a href="PrivacyPolicy.html">Skotos&#146; general Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by this reference as if set out in full.<br>
								<br>
								<b>12. Charges for Service.</b> Skotos will bill you a monthly fee of US$12.95 for use of the Site, Services and Games.

You may also choose to pay additional fees for additional services ("Premium Services"). YOUR MEMBERSHIP FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES UNDER YOUR ACCOUNT WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. If your use of the Site, Services or Games is subject to any use, sales or other taxes, or if Skotos offers any additional services for a fee as noted on the Site and you choose to partake in such additional fee-services, then Skotos may also bill you for any such charges, which will be in addition to the rates noted here. Skotos reserves the right to change its fees and billing methods at any time effective thirty (30) days after notice of the changes are posted on the Site. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms to obtain timely notice of such changes. If any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your account and this agreement as provided in Section 19 (&quot;Termination&quot;). Your continued use of the Games or Services seven (7) days after the changes are posted on the Site will constitute your acceptance of such change. If you pay for the Games and/or Services by credit card, you represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of such credit card. Each month you use the Games and/or Services, you agree and reaffirm that Skotos is authorized to charge your credit card. You agree to promptly notify Skotos of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, and you agree to promptly notify Skotos if your credit card expires or is canceled for any reason.<br>
								<b><br>
									13. International Use.</b> Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO DAMAGES ARISING FROM DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO PERSONAL OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH LIMITATION IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.<br>
								<br>
								<b>17. Consequential Damages.</b> IN NO EVENT WILL SKOTOS, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR SUBCONTRACTORS BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSS OF USE OR COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF REPUDIATION OF CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT SKOTOS, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR SUBCONTRACTORS WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY STATED HEREIN. IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SKOTOS&#146;, ITS AFFILIATES&#146;, LICENSORS&#146; AND SUBCONTRACTORS&#146; LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<br>

								<br>
								<b>22. General Provisions.</b> You may not sublicense, rent, sell, assign or otherwise transfer the rights or obligations granted to you in this agreement, and any such attempted transfer shall be void. If any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such decision shall not affect the enforceability of: (i) such provision under other circumstances, or (ii) the remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances. Skotos&#146; failure to enforce at any time any provision of this agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter.
